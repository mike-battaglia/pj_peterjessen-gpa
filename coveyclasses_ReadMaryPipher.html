Jessen, from his handout given at his  presentation From &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; to &quot;The Shelter of Each  Other:&quot; The Questions, Answers, and Tools Mary Pipher Offers For Use in  &quot;Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls&quot; and in &quot;Rebuilding Our  &quot;Families&quot; and Communities into &quot;Tiospayes,&quot; given at the  joint meeting of the Wilson Cluster Parent Connection and the Wilson High School  PTA, at Wilson High School, November 12, 1996.</p>
  <p>Compiled by Peter J. Jessen, from his handout given at his  presentation From &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; to &quot;The Shelter of Each  Other:&quot; The Questions, Answers, and Tools Mary Pipher Offers For Use in  &quot;Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls&quot; and in &quot;Rebuilding Our  &quot;Families&quot; and Communities into &quot;Tiospayes,&quot; given at the  joint meeting of the Wilson Cluster Parent Connection and the Wilson High  School PTA, at Wilson High School, November 12, 1996.</p>
  <p>Community Activities <br>
    Mary Pipher Reports What Others Are Doing To Rebuild &ldquo;The  Shelters Of Each Other&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shelter's last chapter discusses a series of stories of  people doing projects in their communities, in their homes, their schools,  their churches, etc. (Shelter, pp. 258-261) The projects she discusses include: </p>

    <li>&quot;listening partnerships in which adults and  teenagers meet regularly to talk&quot; who publish &quot;a newsletter and  sponsor drug-free activities for teens&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 259) </li>
    <li>a group that sponsors &quot;activist workshops,  community letter writing campaigns and boycotts of products that hurt  children&quot; (Shelter, p. 259) </li>

    <li>programs in which &quot;youth pledge not to do  drugs or alcohol and to wait for sex until they are older&quot; (Shelter, p.  259) </li>
    <li>&quot;Many towns now have mentoring programs in  which adults meet with young people and help them through their teen  years&quot; (Shelter, p. 259) </li>
    <li>schools with &quot;programs in which business  people come into the school over their lunch hours and read aloud to  children&quot; (Shelter, p. 259) </li>
    <li>&quot;celebrate the coming of age of their  twenty-year olds&quot; with a &quot;special day that includes a lecture on the  rights and responsibilities of adults...both the joys and duties of adulthood  are clarified&quot; (Shelter, p. 260) </li>
    <li>&quot;Some communities are honoring teenagers  for their good behavior. Teens who volunteer, do well academically or create  something important are featured in local news&quot; (Shelter, p. 260) </li>
    <li>a public radio station which &quot;asked teens  to submit tapes of their own music&quot; and then selected &quot;the ten  best...to perform their works over the air&quot; (Shelter, p. 260) </li>
    <li>an &quot;intergenerational program...called the  Environmental Mentor Program&quot; in which &quot;older people in town are paired  with young people&quot; (Shelter, p. 260) </li>
    <li>&quot;random acts of kindness project&rdquo; in which,  &ldquo;every week the local newspaper recognizes a citizen for random acts of  kindness&quot; (Shelter, p. 260) </li>

  </ul>
  <p>Family exercises from OPHELIA which Mary Pipher uses with  girls to help in &ldquo;Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls&rdquo;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;write down three things every day that  (you) felt proud of&quot; (Ophelia, p. 33, 109) </li>
    <li>&quot;write me a letter telling me (your) good  qualities&quot; (Ophelia, p. 33) </li>
    <li>&quot;ask: 'what do you think is fun?&rsquo;&quot; (Ophelia,  p. 85) </li>
    <li>&quot;write down (your) thoughts and feelings and  ... sort out which values of (your) mother's (you) want to keep or reject&quot;  (Ophelia, p. 109) </li>
    <li>&quot;write a [favorite singer]-style song about  (your) feelings&quot; (Ophelia, p. 124) </li>
    <li>&quot;make a friend&quot; (Ophelia, p. 124) </li>
    <li>&quot;talk ten minutes each evening about how their  day had gone&quot; (Ophelia, p. 125)</li>
    <li>for &quot;anger control...punch a pillow&rdquo;  (Ophelia, p. 139) </li>
    <li>for &quot;anger control...jog until she had  'outrun' her anger&quot; (Ophelia, p. 139) </li>
    <li>&quot;write everything you can think of. Get  those feelings out of your chest and onto a piece of paper.&quot; (Ophelia, p.  139) </li>
    <li>&quot;Think what you would want on your epitaph  and tell me next time&quot; (Ophelia, p. 156) </li>
    <li>&quot;record and report ... victories--defined  as times she handled frustration in a mature way.&quot; (Ophelia, p. 157) Victories  are also defined &quot;as times when she acted in accordance with her deepest  values. (Shelter, p. 190) </li>
    <li>&quot;develop an emergency plan for those times  when (you are) tempted to&quot; hurt yourself. &quot;pull out a notebook and  write, write, write every painful, angry emotion...to get those emotions out of  her body and onto a piece of paper&quot; (Ophelia, p. 164) </li>
    <li>To deal with &quot;psychic pain&quot; that comes  with eating disorders, &quot;record how (you) feel at the time of binges&quot; (Ophelia,  p. 167) </li>
    <li>&quot;find something in the natural world that  reminded her of her brother&quot; who had died, &quot;something that could help  her feel connected to him whenever she saw it&quot; (Ophelia, p. 173) </li>
    <li>think about what kind of men (you) like. What  qualities would they have? What would be their interests? How would they treat  (you)?</li>
    <li>When dating, pull out the list and &quot;check  and recheck: 'Is this person meeting my criteria for a good date?'&quot;</li>
    <li>for sexual decision-making: &quot;role-play  seduction scenes...learn to deliver a loud, firm no. If the guy persisted,  ...learn to shout, push, punch and escape&quot; (Ophelia, p. 209) </li>
    <li>&quot;read (them) stories about other kids who  had been hurt and how they came to terms with it&quot; (Ophelia, p. 221) </li>
    <li>use a punching bag; connect the anger as you  punch. &quot;visualize the boys, the car, the rape as (you) hit&quot;; get  &quot;all that anger out of her and in the bag&quot; (Ophelia, p. 223) </li>
    <li>&quot;To stay on course you must follow your own  North Star, your sense of who you truly are. Only by orienting north can you  chart a course and maintain it, only by orienting north can you keep from being  blown all over the sea. True freedom has more to do with following the North  Star than with going whichever way the wind blows...Freedom is sailing toward  your dreams.&quot; (Ophelia, pp. 254-255) </li>
    <li>To answer your question, &quot;How do I know who  I really am or what I truly want?&quot;  ask the following questions ( (Ophelia, p.  255) </li>
    <li>How do I feel right now?</li>
    <li>What do I think?</li>
    <li>What are my values?</li>
    <li>How would I describe myself to myself?</li>
    <li>How do I see myself in the future?</li>
    <li>What kind of work do I like?</li>
    <li>What kind of leisure do I like?</li>
    <li>When do I feel most myself?</li>
    <li>How have I changed since I entered puberty?</li>
    <li>What kinds of people do I respect?</li>
    <li>How am I similar to and different from my  mother?</li>
    <li>How am I similar to and different from my  father?</li>
    <li>What goals do I have for myself as a person?</li>
    <li>What are my strengths and weaknesses?</li>
    <li>What would I be proud of on my deathbed?</li>
    <li>&quot;Encourage girls to keep diaries and to  write poetry and autobiographies. Girls this age love to write. Their journals  are places where they can be honest and whole. In their writing they can  clarify, conceptualize and evaluate their experiences. Writing their thoughts  and feelings strengthens their sense of self. Their journals are place where  their point of view on the universe matters. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mary Pipher, from SHELTER, on Ceremonies, rituals, healings,  and personal/family victories</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Before the Seneca tribe made changes, the elders  would ask, &quot;How will they affect the next seven generations? ... We are  not even asking how our explosion in technology and media is affecting the current  generations.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 89) </li>
    <li> &ldquo;I use  assignments to help families clarify their positions, discover new things about  themselves and stay motivated to work toward long-term goals. Assignments are  experiments that let a family see what happens if they do things directly. ... A  family need not be in therapy to follow assignments. Families can have weekly  meetings on their own and invent assignments for themselves.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 145) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I ask families to record their victories. Family  member keep track of successes and report on them... Victories can be defined  as anything the family wants to do more of. ... Most victories in life are  small ones. Small victories are significant when they involve overcoming  personal weaknesses, helping others and making the self or the family  stronger.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 145) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;Design experiments to help...sanctify time. Set  aside several special days a year.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 149) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I encourage people to take minivacations where  the family makes a few moments special. Small rituals at dinner, such as saying  grace, unplugging the phones, turning off the TV and lighting candles, can  hallow family time.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 149) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I recommend that parents schedule once-a-week  breakfasts alone with their adolescents. It's a good time to talk about life. I  encourage these breakfasts to be a free zone in which grades, chores, rule  violations and money are not mentioned.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 149) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I suggest writing. Here are examples--write  essays on gifts you received from hour family of origin, write what you learned  from your father and your mother. I like letters--letters of intent, letters of  reconciliation, thank-you letters, promissory notes and love letters.&rdquo; (Shelter,  p. 149) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;Family rituals protect time.... morning...or  bedtime. Having bedtalk with children every night is a way to give each day a  closing ceremony.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 231) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I encourage families to orchestrate  &quot;corrective emotional experiences&quot; ...to mitigate the pain of an  earlier event. For example, a couple who fought at a restaurant return and have  another dinner...in which they show great tenderness toward each other.&rdquo; (Shelter,  p. 146) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;With adolescents corrective emotional  experiences work better than punishments. Relationship-oriented reparations are  often the most effective. ... A tantrum at dinner [results in being] asked to  cook and serve a candle light dinner to the family on another night. ... rude  to relatives [results in ] spending an evening putting photos in a family  album. ... Reparations have the teenagers working with an adult on useful  projects that teach skills [such as] helping a parent paint the house, do the  taxes or learn to use the computer...helping with the gardening, the recycling  or the care of an elderly relative.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 146) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;Design healing ceremonies for emotional pain.&rdquo; (Shelter,  p. 146) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I recommend ceremonies of acknowledgment and  forgiveness after an extramarital affair. ... After betrayals, violence and  losses, ceremonies can help with healing.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 146) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;All families have unfinished business from the  ways in which they have hurt each other and have been hurt by the outside  world. In almost all cases, healing is possible with the right words and the  right ceremonies.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Healing rituals [could include] telling their  bad memories and then telling their dreams for the future. Talk about the bad  things and then the good things.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 200) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;Design a ceremony of hope.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I encourage families to develop rituals. These  can be for seasons, significant family events and rites of passage.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I encourage families to have time outdoors,  vacations and holiday meals.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 148) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I encourage families to increase their  expressions of affection...to hug each other, to compliment each other, and to  say how they feel about each other.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 148) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;I encourage people to write notes, make short  phone calls, do small favors, and express affection in whatever ways it can be  received.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 148) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;In our rapidly changing world, people who stay  married for fifty years really have multiple marriages to the same mate. They  have a romantic relationship, a child-rearing relationship, and later one  strong in companionship and caretaking. One marriage ceremony at the beginning  is not enough to hold such a marriage in place. Couples need new ceremonies and  rites of passage, second honeymoons and even third and fourth ones. It's good  to renew vows and write new vows every few years.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 237) </li>
    <li>&ldquo;Sibling relationships need much more support  and celebration than they receive in our culture. ... If we are lucky, our  siblings are our built-in lifelong friends. ... Sibling relationships can be  strengthened in a hundred way: regular phone calls, visits and letters,  reunions, shared celebrations... [siblings] who take their mutual children on  trips...every summer.&rdquo; (Shelter, p. 237)  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above is from Resource Book of Community Initiatives: Rebuilding  Our Families and Communities Symposium, featuring Mary Pipher, Lewis and Clark  College, September 12 and 13, 1997, pp. 63-66.</p>
  <p>From the cover of the Resource Book:</p>
  <p>Undermined by a host of influences that invade &quot;houses  without walls,&quot; families blame themselves for what is essentially a  cultural problem. See hope and strength &quot;in the shelter of each  other,&quot; the wisdom of Mary Pipher, and the dedicated and innovative spirit  of local community initiatives.</p>
  <p>From a brochure for the Symposium: &quot;…for understanding  the challenges facing American families so we can take action to save and  strengthen our most valuable institution -- the family,&quot; Doubletree Hotel,  Portland, Oregon, sponsored by Lewis &amp; Clark College, September 12-13, 1997</p>
