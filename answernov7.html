Subject: Answering the Governor's Question on the Radio This Morning Regarding 
        How to Finance Stadiums Without New Taxes<br>

Otis Courtney just called me to ask me to contact the Governor after hearing<br>
his asking the radio interviewer for answers to how to fund a new stadium<br>
for the Twins. I could not get through although I did leave a voice mail<br>
message for Keith Rawen of his staff.<br>
In August I sent a 22 page letter to House Speaker Sviggum and Senate<br>
Majority Leader Moe, along with 6 attachments, regarding how they could 
        set<br>
about solving the stadium issue, I outlined how to do so WITHOUT ANY NEW<br>
TAXES. In the letter to Speaker Sviggum and President Moe, 10 ways are<br>
listed, with verification, of which 5 are private pay formulas. My<br>
particular model, &quot;Generic Model&quot; provides 8 ways of raising 
        the funds and<br>
40 ways in 26 categories for generating revenues, which could be used 
        for<br>
and by news stadiums for the Twins, Vikes, and Gophers, as well as by 
        the<br>
Metrodome. Please note: one of the ten refers to the proposal Carl Pohlad<br>
received three years ago regarding how he could achieve a new stadium 
        for<br>
the Twins without having to go to the legislature. You can see that August<br>
letter plus the six attachments on my web site which just went up last<br>
Saturday, www.peterjessen-gpa.com My most recent take on the subject is 
        in<br>
the left hand column site list under &quot;MN Stadium Games Continued&quot;. <br>
Not knowing who to send this to, as there is, inexplicably, no &quot;hot 
        button&quot;<br>
related to stadiums, I am sending it to all on your page, as it effects<br>
them, directly or indirectly, too. And, as my goal remains to be as open 
        as<br>
possible, I am also sending this to the legislative leaders and their 
        staffs<br>
to whom I've sent the earlier materials. This way everyone knows. I did<br>
not send it to you earlier as the Governer's position was that this is 
        up to<br>
the legislature. However, on his radio show this morning, he asked how 
        to<br>
fund stadiums. Otis heard his comments, called me, and asked me to call 
        the<br>
Governor as we have the answer to his question. The items on my web site<br>
answer the question.<br>
The materials above were done for Otis Courtney of Edina, who developed 
        the<br>
www.vikingsstadium.com web page. He first asked me to do a proposal for 
        the<br>
49ers. Then he suggested that I recast it for the Vikings. When I was 
        in<br>
town last April I met with an individual who is involved in stadium<br>
construction. He said all major league teams of all sports should use 
        my<br>
model. He asked me to put it into a generic form, which I did. That is 
        the<br>
version on my website. <br>
I am from Portland, Oregon. I am in town this week. My cel is<br>
503-913-3849. Otis and I would be glad to meet with the Governor or with<br>
Keith Rawen, or with whoever else the Governor or Keith suggest we meet,<br>
and, of course, with any of those on the legislative list which has received<br>
all of these materials as well, as explained below.<br>
However, as you can see from my site, when I put it up I still thought 
        my<br>
thesis of building a stadium each for the Twins, Vikings, and Gophers, 
        and<br>
keep the Metrodome profitable too was still possible. Just imagine the<br>
jobs, the boost to the economy, the additional taxes for education and 
        elder<br>
care, etc., that such a project could bring to the state and serve as 
        a<br>
model for the nation, and make you big bucks in theh process. As I put 
        up<br>
my site I came across Jay Weiner's book &quot;Stadium Games: Fifty Years 
        of Big<br>
League Greed and Bush League Boondoggles,&quot; giving the history of 
        stadiums<br>
going back to the 1950's. The book makes it clear that the &quot;consensus&quot; 
        in<br>
Minnesota is that only three teams can be supported, and that any choice<br>
between the Twins and the Vikings = Twins. However, I still believed it<br>
could all be overcome; However, after reading Sid Hartman's columns over<br>
the last several days, I now believe &quot;the fix&quot; is in (see next 
        paragraph)<br>
for a Vikes departure, Twins in a remodelled Metrodome, and a new Gopher<br>
stadium (unless the calibration of &quot;the fix&quot; has been too fine 
        tuned and the<br>
Twins leave town too).<br>
My own take is this: the previous owners of the Vikings were unwilling 
        to<br>
use their pocket change to make a stadium deal happen (and most of the 
        ten<br>
hadn't paid a dime for the team, just as Carl Pohlad didn't pay a dime 
        for<br>
the Twins, as each set used loans for which game revenues are used to 
        pay<br>
the debt service). NFL and Vikings testimony in the mid-90's said that<br>
without a new stadium, the team could not be competitive, and they would<br>
have to move. So these rich guys sold an out of towner willing to go<br>
forward (Red loves to own teams). They knew that if the legislatuare<br>
wouldn't come up with the money, and he had to move, he would get the 
        heat,<br>
not them. Very clever. The Twins would then get a remodelled Metrodome<br>
after the Vikings leave, and the Gophers would get a new stadium and no<br>
longer have to compete with the Vikes for the loyalty of fans. That is 
        the<br>
end game, the &quot;understanding&quot; of the players, in my view. I'm 
        open to a<br>
different theory, but these kinds of things just don't happen. <br>
Carl Pohlad, obviously, as any neurologist could tell you, minimally has<br>
senility plaque short circuiting his brain or some kind of dementia caused<br>
either by TIA's or small strokes. I took care of my aged (80's) parents 
        in<br>
similar conditions (17 months with my dad until he passed and 8 years 
        with<br>
my mom until she passed in January of this year). I''m well versed in 
        long<br>
term care, multi-enfarc dementia, walkers, bed ridden, etc. It appears 
        no<br>
one is willing to take over from him, although Bud Selig, who the paper 
        says<br>
talks to Carl weekly, obviously has figured it out and is playing Carl, 
        and<br>
the Twin City press, like a violin.<br>
The ill-considered 1986 Federal law (also discussed in a separate piece 
        on<br>
my web page, also sent to the legislature et al), is onen of the culprits.<br>
However, ownershp of the stadiums or joint ownership would obviate it 
        and<br>
allow revenues to pay the bonds used to cover the amount not raised<br>
privately (ALTHOUGH my model suggests that if a Dreamworks model is used,<br>
that won't be necessary). <br>
Please note, also supporting my thesis about the &quot;understanding&quot; 
        of the<br>
players, who are all positioning themselves to wash their hands of the<br>
Vikings leaving town, is that NO ONE from the House or Senate, neither<br>
elected leader or staff, has contacted me. No one. I work by clues. That<br>
is a big one. What clue, in this regard, will I get from the Governor?<br>
