    <section><b>2. Background to these &quot;Lists&quot; and &quot;Recipes&quot;</b><br>
&nbsp;<br>
In his book &#147;The Social Construction of Reality,&#148; Peter Berger 
        explains the importance of developing roles and the routines that will 
        enable us to sustain our daily activities.&nbsp; We are born without any 
        genetic, biologically imprinted instincts for human social interaction 
        (if we were, all human beings the world over would respond the same way 
        to each other for any similar situation).&nbsp; To deal with this &quot;instinct 
        deprived&quot; state, we create &quot;instinct substitutes&quot; (roles, 
        habits, routines).&nbsp; Berger points out that &quot;everyday life is 
        dominated by the pragmatic motive&quot; of having to get things done.&nbsp; 
        Most often we do things by routine, by habit.&nbsp; We follow what he 
        calls, following Alfred Schutz, &quot;recipe knowledge,&quot; which means 
        knowledge that, like a cook in a kitchen, is &quot;knowledge limited to 
        pragmatic competence in routine performances.&quot;&nbsp; These &quot;recipes&quot; 
        make up our &quot;social stock of knowledge.&quot;&nbsp; These recipes 
        provide us with our &quot;institutionally appropriate rules of conduct.&quot; 
        This is when I first learned of the &quot;why&quot; behind the importance 
        of lists.&nbsp; Hence the term the &quot;social construction of reality,&quot; 
        which refers to small &quot;tee&quot; truth, not Ultimate big Tee truths.&nbsp; 
        Truth is truth, but how we interpret it and accept it determines how it 
        will affect it (Copernicus and Gallileo, Bell Curve, identity culture 
        conflicts, etc.).&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
For many of us, these recipes become separate &quot;to do&quot; lists 
        or find their way into the columns of our daily planners.&nbsp; To be 
        effective (i.e., making us want to actually follow them), they must be 
        part of some large set of plans (short, medium, long range) which have 
        been translated into goals.&nbsp; These roles are mediated by what society 
        as a whole expects of us (the way we play our roles) and what we want 
        to do (how we ourselves want to play our roles).&nbsp; We then have to 
        ask ourselves this question:&nbsp; how can we develop goals and objectives 
        and then motivate ourselves to bridge this difference between what is 
        expected of us and what we want to do, learn the roles we need to play 
        and then go out on the &quot;stages&quot; of life and play them well in 
        order to meet our goals and objectives?&nbsp; We need help to follow our 
        goal lists.&nbsp; We need lists that are part of an overall goal meeting 
        plan and which include the positive, &quot;learned optimism&quot; supported 
        by &quot;positive self-talk.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In his lectures on emotional intelligence, health and relationships for 
        managing thoughts, feelings and actions, William H. Polonsky (in February 
        1998) recommended as a good book on motivation, Facilitating Treatment 
        Adherence by the cognitive-behavioral medical psychologist Donald Meichenbaum 
        (founder of Cognitive Behavior Therapy) and his colleague Dennis Turk, 
        a professor of psychiatry.&nbsp; The book is for medical doctors on how 
        to facilitate a partnership between themselves and their patients that 
        would result in the various treatments prescribed being followed by both 
        the doctors in the office visit and the patient at home.&nbsp; In other 
        words, how to ensure that the action is taken to meet the goals that are 
        part of the treatment plan.&nbsp; They demonstrate empirically that the 
        key to adherence (meeting treatment goals) is to develop and make lists 
        and empower their patients and themselves to follow them.&nbsp; These 
        lists are like the recipes discussed above.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When I asked Don Meichenbaum, at a May 1998 conference on cognitive behavior 
        therapy, if I had correctly interpreted his work about the importance 
        of &quot;lists&quot; and &quot;empowerment,&quot; he said yes except for 
        one caveat:&nbsp; it is not empowerment if it is not negotiable.&nbsp; 
        Ordering someone to do something is not the same as empowerment.&nbsp; 
        We can take that point on &quot;negotiable&quot; a step further to include 
        not just with others but also with ourselves:&nbsp; we must have positive 
        &quot;self-talk&quot; negotiating our overcoming of the negatives of our 
        fears and sense of helplessness if we are to be successful both personally 
        and in teams with others.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In conversations (in April and September 1998), with Nicholas Hall, at 
        two conferences on the immune system, confirmed the need to use the same 
        approach to dealing with stress and good <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Health:&nbsp; develop programs or lists, follow them, evaluate them as 
        you go, and make changes as experience dictates (Hall is one of the pioneers 
        in the new field of psychoimmuneurology (the field is so new that some 
        call it psychoneuroimmunology) and developer of the preventive health 
        care program for Celebration City at Disneyworld).&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
One such &quot;program&quot; is that of &quot;cross-stressing.&quot;&nbsp; 
        We can't eliminate stress in our lives, he said, and that, indeed, stress 
        is also &quot;a stimulator for growth.&quot;&nbsp; Muscle strength is 
        obtained by putting it through stress and strain.&nbsp; The key is recovery 
        in between.&nbsp; Through the practice of cross-stressing, the recovery 
        time can be reduced.&nbsp; For athletes, this can be achieved by switching 
        between aerobic and anaerobic exercise.&nbsp; For individuals it is achieved 
        by simulating stress events in order to learn what lowers the negative 
        aspects of stress the fastest.&nbsp; Success, individually and working 
        together on teams is often a reflection of the ability of that &quot;recovery 
        time,&quot; something which can be hastened by &quot;positive self-talk.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cross stressing is also used by FBI and SWAT teams, who use this approach 
        to enable agents to recover quickly from the stress (including the sense 
        of feeling helpless) of entering dangerous situations so they can immediately 
        recover from any fear or trepidation and return quickly to the calm needed 
        to make good decisions, as high stress can not only shut down the ability 
        to think it can shut down the ability to even act. </section>
