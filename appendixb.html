<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p align="center"><b>APPENDIX B: Trends Supporting This 
        Model </b></p>
            <p>The biggest trend for the 1st decade of the 21st century:&nbsp; moving 
              toward tax cutting, and away from tax maximizing, in both in government 
              and tax payer philosophy, attitude, and readiness.</p>
            <p>The book &#147;cluetrain manifesto:&nbsp; the end of business as usual&#148;:&nbsp; 
              signals and explores a sea change already nearing flood tide in today's 
              wired world.&nbsp; As a result, &quot;markets are getting smarter faster 
              than most companies.&nbsp; &#133;&nbsp; Companies that aren't listening&#133;are 
              missing a dire warning.&nbsp; Companies that aren't engaging in them are 
              missing an unprecedented opportunity.&quot;&nbsp; See chapter 5, &quot;The 
              Hyperlinked Organization.&quot;</p>
            <p>The book &#147;FutureWealth: Investing in the Second Great Wave of Technology&#148;, 
              states that cheap information carried by cheap communications ha given 
              us our long boom, and that those who understand and act accordingly will 
              survive, and those who don't won't, as no corner of the globe is insulated.&nbsp; 
              The handling of event horizons (what's coming that you may or may not 
              be able to predict), will either save you from getting sucked in or not, 
              so exploit it to survive (see chapter 14).&nbsp; Their chapters on &quot;The 
              Living Room Revolution&quot; and &quot;Kid Power&quot; are also instructive 
              for the stadium conversation.&nbsp; Minnesota particularly is aware of 
              what happens when event horizons are missed or mis-handled, as represented 
              by the failure of the &quot;BUNCH&quot;, two of which are from the Twin 
              Cities:&nbsp; Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell, as 
              they were unable to stay clear of the Event Horizons that caused them 
              to slip into a price-performance Black Hole.</p>
            <p>How Web sites &quot;change everything&quot; by organizations being, book 
              title:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Blown to Bits.&#148;&nbsp; This recent business 
              book introduces us to four concepts of (1) reach, (2) richness, (3) affiliation, 
              and (4) navigation. &nbsp;The authors sharply note that, in the new economy, 
              the only competition is the consumer.&nbsp; The Internet has changed everything.&nbsp; 
              &quot;The real question is:&nbsp; what can we do for the consumer that 
              she cannot do for herself?&nbsp; The answer, in an Internet world, is 
              to enable people to get through the immenseness of so much choice.&nbsp; 
              How?&nbsp; By being a good navigator&quot;.&nbsp; Navigation, according 
              to Blown to Bits, will be the &quot;fulcrum around which competitive advantage 
              hinges.&quot;&nbsp; The Internet allows navigation to be cheap, and derives 
              its power &quot;by affiliating as closely as possible with the interests 
              of the consumer.&quot;&nbsp; Providing both richness of content (video/DVD 
              referencing and backed up by the team&#146;s Web Page) and reach (many 
              users city and state and world-wide), and affiliation (the desire to use 
              the team&#146;s web page as their web portal).&nbsp; Net Intrust can help 
              the team develop a web portal that will serve as a navigator for those 
              seeking information about the process from both sides of the debate.</p>
            <p>Other trends and event horizons to watch</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; This model discusses throughout existing and upcoming 
              event horizons for generating new, direct, and immediate revenue streams 
              for the team.&nbsp; Some are in the future; but many can begin now, particularly 
              many of the 40 ways in 26 categories of I.B.&nbsp; We list many in Section 
              II of this proposal, and more in this appendix.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Money is not infinite, although invested money 
              is very much &#147;a renewable resource&#148; Trees are renewable as well, 
              if you don&#146;t cut them all down and burn them faster than replacements 
              can be grown.&nbsp; China cut most of her trees down for fuel, etc., and 
              now hasn&#146;t enough arable soil to feed its own population (their leaders 
              do well but the majority do not).&nbsp; England was about to denude its 
              rock when they discovered coal.&nbsp; England kept its trees, has arable 
              land, and can feed itself.&nbsp; Ditto coal and oil in the U.S.&nbsp; 
              Indeed, oil was seen as the end of pollution because it enabled the automobile 
              to replace the horse and the horses&#146; thousands of gallons of horse 
              urine that &#147;washed&#148; the streets daily, not to mention tons of 
              &#147;fresh&#148; manure daily (projected to bury New York City under 
              its then increasing amounts before the motor car and truck).&nbsp; The 
              Internet is a new discovery, not unlike coal and oil, which preserves 
              other resources.&nbsp; Businesses are using it save billions each.&nbsp; 
              Schools could do the same if they would adopt it in that fashion, saving 
              hundreds of millions in every major school district.&nbsp; In terms of 
              business, the trees are operations dollars (see Appendix I).&nbsp; In 
              terms of education, the trees are tax payer dollars.&nbsp; In terms of 
              professional sports teams, the Internet represents not only a savings 
              of operational dollars but also a contributor to revenue and a solidifier 
              of their brand name and a spread of their fan base throughout the country 
              and around the world through its web portal.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; DITTO free agency:&nbsp; transition to (1) a senior 
              management model, rather than union-management model, and (2) engage in 
              joint wealth building, or teams will spend themselves into insolvency 
              as baseball is doing and as the National Football League is on the brink 
              of doing, given the break from the &#147;norm&#148; of first Jerry Jones 
              of Dallas and now Daniel Snyder of Washington.&nbsp; See <a href="appendixe.html">Appendix 
                E</a>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; The following player compensation figures 
              for the following players illustrate the &#147;over cutting of trees&#148; 
              by baseball, a lesson the National Football League needs to learn now, 
              or suffer its peril if it does not:&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Alex Rodriquez&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Texas Rangers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              for $252 million over 10 years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Mike Hampton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Colorado 
              Rockies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for $121 million over 8 years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Mike Musina&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              to the NY Yankees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              for $88.5 million over 6 years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Ken Griffey, Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Cincinnati 
              Reds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for $116.5 million over 9 years<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; MLB Commissioner Bud Selig told 
              a Senate subcommittee on November 21, 2000, that with the current labor 
              agreement expiring next year, and with teams losing money, that &#147;it 
              is time for sweeping changes&#148; in the sports economic structure.&nbsp; 
              Please note:&nbsp; this model is the FIRST to outline sweeping change 
              for sports&#146; economic structure.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the problems is approaching purchasing 
              in the old way of debt (Washington&#146;s debt ratio of 80% requires Snyder 
              to &#147;break from the norm&#148;, just as Jerry Jones realizing Dallas 
              was losing $1 million a month required him to do the same).&nbsp; A specialized 
              investment model, especially for stadiums, can prevent increasing debt 
              ratios as well as help reduce them considerably, as this model demonstrates.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp; One part of the solution is to 
              create an investment pool that will pay players for years out of earnings 
              of the pool, so that it eventually self pays.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp; Three keys to wealth building for the future, in 
              order to avoid wealth busting for this &#147;senior executive team&#148; 
              of owners, coaches, and players:&nbsp; (1) dealing with the salary cap 
              and free agency such that the goose that lays golden eggs for all (team/owner/coaches/ 
              players/municipalities, etc.) is not killed, maimed or injured.&nbsp; 
              (2) give the teams more room to maneuver, and (3) transition the &#147;union&#148; 
              to act in concert as partners, both representing part of the management 
              group and being part of management nonetheless, and thus avoiding the 
              ludicrous &#147;union strikes&#148;, that can only be a PR and wealth 
              destroying nightmares (recall Patrick Ewing&#146;s PR foot in mouth statement, 
              in which he said players had a right to strike in order &#147;to put food 
              on our tables so we can feed our families.&#148;&nbsp; Given his millions 
              a year, this remark turned off a lot of fans.&nbsp; That players don&#146;t 
              understand this is a revealing and compelling condemnation of agents who 
              work to maximize their own returns without a larger picture of what is 
              good for the game and the long term itself (their players can come and 
              go, and they can offer up new sacrifices on the altar of near sightedness, 
              placing the goose that lays the golden eggs on the sacrificial altar also.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the Executive Recruiter 
              model can solve many issues, including viewing player demands within the 
              realm of reality and parallel to the rest of society, and hence need to 
              be listened to while transitioning from union-management model to senior 
              executive team model.&nbsp; Points to consider from corporate America, 
              with lessons for any team as well as entire professional leagues:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; 
              Revolving door at the top:&nbsp; 118 CEO exits in August 2000 (23 from 
              dot.coms)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; 
              A white hot market for talent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; 
              NOTE:&nbsp; &#147;they really don&#146;t work for money anymore.&nbsp; 
              It&#146;s beyond that.&nbsp; It&#146;s more about whether they like the 
              work they&#146;re doing and whether they are passionate about the company.&#148;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; 
              With significant wealth being created, the corporate trend is to make 
              changes based on quality-of-life reasons (hence the need for &#147;golden 
              handcuffs&#148;)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; 
              &#147;Mere money is not enough.&#148;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; 
              But when money is important, the &#147;mantra&#148; in &#147;dot-coms&#148; 
              is &#147;just pay me in cash,&#148; as stock is too volatile.&nbsp; Senior 
              execs are paid signing bonuses, some six and seven figures in size<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; 
              Corporations take 3-5 months to do a search and another year to achieve 
              integration into the organization:&nbsp; these are costs that don&#146;t 
              show up on the company&#146;s financial report (nor do the future costs 
              of &#147;golden parachutes&#148; demanded by top executives before signing).&nbsp; 
              The same occurs in signing players.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp; MLB is in the process of setting up tremendous 
              potential losses from the strike that now seems inevitable when the current 
              contract ends (unless they adopt, in the meantime, the compensation Plan&#148; 
              approach outlined in this model, in order to avert the strike).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j.&nbsp; The NHL has seen the future and doesn&#146;t 
              like what it sees, calling salaries &#147;grotesque&#148; and calling 
              for them to come down, identifying the increases as a &#147;tipping point&#148; 
              moment in sports that can tip the enterprise as a whole away from wealth 
              building.&nbsp; The battle, of course, is over&nbsp; the &#147;precise 
              number [that] must be agreed upon by the league and the union.&#148;&nbsp; 
              If they were partners, this would make sense.&nbsp; But they are set up 
              as adversaries.&nbsp; And the &#147;grotesque&#148; led to a revolt by 
              Canadian tax payers such that Canadians teams have or are about to move 
              to the U.S., as Canadians chanted &#147;no tax dollars for billionaire 
              owners and millionaire players&#148; (key here is to understand that all 
              that was asked for from the tax payers was $3 million per team; think 
              about that when thinking of the amounts being asked for in the U.S.).&nbsp; 
              The goose is cooked in Canada.&nbsp; Warning has been given.&nbsp; Ditto 
              in Florida where, in May of 2001, tax payers cheered when their legislature 
              refused to consider the requested stadium deal for the MLB Marlins.&nbsp; 
              The goose can still be spared in the U.S.&nbsp; Owners and players must 
              consider themselves partners, not as adversaries.&nbsp; The old joke applies 
              about when you owe the bank a million you are no longer in debt but in 
              business with your partner.&nbsp; Players earning 6 and 7 figure incomes 
              are partners, not employees.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k.&nbsp; Soaring MLB costs may be checked by insurance 
              companies refusing to cover such high salaries.&nbsp; Instead of dealing 
              with the problem of high salaries, especially the guaranteed ones, owners 
              in MLB have hidden behind insurance policies that paid off the unplayed 
              years.&nbsp; That Land of Oz curtain is about to come down, as insurance 
              companies will soon lose money if thy continue underwriting such policies.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l.&nbsp;&nbsp; Potential backlash against &#147;billionaire 
              owners&#148; and &#147;millionaire players&#148;.&nbsp; There are theories 
              from the late 19th and early 20th century that state that modern life 
              for many is a mediocre one, and they resent those with extraordinary lives, 
              which is all the more reasons for a win-win media/public posture.&nbsp; 
              When The TV Guide (May 19-25, 2001) features an article on sports (&#147;Phil 
              Mushnick on Sports&#148;, p. 55), with this heading:&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Home 
              Sweet Home:&nbsp; Facing rising ticket and food pries and volatile athletes, 
              your best bet is to stay safe at home,&#148; then we know a backlash is 
              well under way.&nbsp; This is another reason to use the investment financing 
              vehicle (#4 of the 8 ways).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l.&nbsp; Two routes to take to ensure mutual wealth 
              building:&nbsp; a macro-institutional one for the league as a whole, and 
              a micro-institutional one for the team by itself (or any other team acting 
              independently) and its players, as discussed below.&nbsp; Either way, 
              owners and players will both be enchanted in both material and non-material 
              terms.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp; m.&nbsp; Macro-institutional solutions to consider by the League 
              (balancing freedom of the group and the freedom of each team):&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              (1)&nbsp; Easiest:&nbsp; a severe luxury tax on big spenders to be divided 
              among those who don&#146;t go over their cap, which is the least rocking 
              the boat approach, and greatly slows down the inevitable switch of fans 
              to cheaper sporting events, prolonging but not ultimately saving the goose; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              (2)&nbsp; Laziest:&nbsp; adopt union wage structure policies, and attach 
              earnings by years served only (the downside is that few players would 
              play longer than five years before owners would cut them loose for the 
              new crop of lower paid young players, which could hurt the goose and perhaps 
              cause another league to form; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              (3)&nbsp; Best:&nbsp; create an investment fund for all players, to parallel 
              the union retirement fund, emphasizing life long earnings not just the 
              playing years.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n.. Micro-institutional solutions to consider by individual 
              teams:&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              (1). contract consisting of 12 salary parts (as described in II.A.), including 
              salary, signing bonus, investment fund, and nine other salary parts; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              (2). Provide an &#147;incubator&#148; for players interested in developing 
              their own post-playing businesses, as Cris Carter of the Minnesota Vikings 
              is interested in doing;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              (3). Create a &#147;life style&#148; and corporate culture that the players, 
              especially those with wives and children, are not going to want to leave.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o.. To avoid future conflicts, involve players now 
              to participate in discussions regarding changing the model.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.. To avoid the future horizon destruction down the 
              black hole of price, the League needs to get everyone on the same page:&nbsp; 
              as partners, not adversaries, and from there work to resolve the free 
              agency and salary caps.&nbsp; Otherwise, they can work together to develop 
              the service and ceremony of the future horizon event of burying the goose 
              that laid their golden eggs.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q.&nbsp; There is a wise saying, &#147;Do good things 
              and good things follow,&#148; and &#147;Like produces like.&#148;&nbsp; 
              This is what is happens with community programs, which many teams don&#146;t 
              have.&nbsp; This is what now can rise up to complement even more what 
              teams are doing.&nbsp; To keep fans, teams need to return to the community 
              with community programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; When teams feel they have now &#147;arrived,&#148; 
              and no longer need to pay fans attention, they are squandering good will, 
              and it won&#146;t be there when they need it.&nbsp; It is no longer an 
              option.&nbsp; It part of the new fan-team relationship paradigm.&nbsp; 
              It does wonders for both the community and the players, especially young 
              people in the community.&nbsp; In a word, teams need to give back to those 
              who give so much to them.&nbsp; Even though this is heart felt, it can 
              also be good marketing and provide a positive way to maintain a good hold 
              on to your community audience and fan base, as well as legislators and 
              the media, especially when a team doesn&#146;t win the championship.&nbsp; 
              Fine tuning the community work to complement the marketing efforts can 
              contribute positively to the overall goal of wealth producing while simultaneously 
              saving tax payer tax paying.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.&nbsp; Free agency makes it all the more important 
              to have continuity as much as possible with coaches and staff, so they 
              can develop systems that help players improve, a system that players like, 
              and enables them to realize, even with parity, that they can win, and 
              if not win, then give them a very good game.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.&nbsp; Professional sports are in the sports-entertainment-real 
              estate-communications-public space business,&nbsp; although not all teams 
              are run that way (resulting in their claiming they have to leave town 
              to survive).&nbsp; But to achieve parity as well as exciting play, the 
              need is to make a thorough and honest assessment of salary caps and guarantees 
              as opposed to outcome incentives.&nbsp; A team is not helped when it has 
              an inflated payroll not in line with earned accomplishments, which also 
              precludes other options.&nbsp; But a pro sport is not a typical business, 
              which can shutter, move to Indonesia, or wherever.&nbsp; Sports teams 
              form a bond of trust with their fans, and therefore are not as easy to 
              move, as moves injure the goose.&nbsp; And teams can&#146;t all move to 
              NYC to duke it out with the Yanks and Giants for the loyalty of fans and 
              the extra TV money.&nbsp; Hence, to make the League a greater business, 
              it must spread out into new cities while at the same time stay with its 
              parity process.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; u.&nbsp; Players need to recognize that the 
              salary pendulum has to swing back.&nbsp; As Klobuchar noted in 1991, there 
              was no mobility or bargaining power accorded to players that was comparable 
              to baseball, or, as noted by different writers, teams with high payrolls 
              can still be under achievers (Redskins, Trailblazers) who could not generate 
              a winning chemistry.&nbsp; Low payrolls reflected owners&#146; tight control, 
              which is why players viewed themselves as workers for tough bosses.&nbsp; 
              But that has all changed.&nbsp; Recommended here is to drop that labor-management 
              model, which is no longer appropriate for the 21st century, and exchange 
              it for an integrated senior executive structure as outlined in this model.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp; The future for any business is with the young of 
              society.&nbsp; This quote from a high school student in 2001 illustrates 
              what is at stake:&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;professional sports&#148; are &#147;dying 
              a death of money,&#148; causing high school kids, according to this high 
              school writer, &#147;to lose interest in pro sports.&#148;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; w.&nbsp; Without adopting this new model, there is the danger 
              of &#147;the dilution by free riders&#148; profit strategy.&nbsp; A decade 
              or so ago, the San Diego baseball team purposefully traded its highly 
              paid players and signed youthful yet much cheaper players, and netted 
              significant profits by eliminating the high pay roll.&nbsp; They provided 
              top baseball players for their fans by &#147;producing&#148; the other 
              teams at home games, essentially &#147;importing&#148; top talent for 
              the pleasure of the ticket holder, and thus became &#147;free riders&#148; 
              on the backs of the high payrolls of the other teams.&nbsp; Taken to its 
              obvious conclusion, a few teams would have the best players, and attendance, 
              in the stadium and before television, would dwindle, and with that, profits 
              and salaries.&nbsp;</p>
