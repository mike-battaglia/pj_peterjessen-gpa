  <p><b>11.&nbsp; 6 LISTS FOR GOAL SETTING&nbsp; plus a worksheet</b><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Albert Einstein is reported to have said that a definition of insanity 
    is to keep doing the same thing and yet expect different results.&nbsp; 
    To set goals is, by definition, to expect change.&nbsp; Change can be 
    exciting or frightening.&nbsp; Regardless, change can be transforming.&nbsp; 
    In Peter Daniels' words, you can &quot;take hold of your life from this 
    day&quot; by planning &quot;a far better way.&quot;&nbsp; That is what 
    goal setting is all about.&nbsp; Here are several approaches to goal setting<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>ZIG ZIGLAR's LIST FOR GOAL SETTING</b><br>
    (in See You At The Top, pp. 191-197)<br>
    LISTS seven points for not only goal setting but also for &quot;a goals 
    program.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    Goals are not enough.&nbsp; You need an action program for making them 
    happen.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    For each goal list the following:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Identify and state your goal<br>
    2.&nbsp; List benefits to be attained by reaching this goal<br>
    3.&nbsp; Identify major obstacles and mountains to climb to reach this 
    goal<br>
    4.&nbsp; List skills or knowledge required to reach this goal<br>
    5.&nbsp; Identify individuals, groups, companies and organizations to 
    work with to reach this goal.<br>
    6.&nbsp; Specify a plan of action to reach this goal.<br>
    7.&nbsp; State your completion date.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Note again the use of the most powerful tool each of us has:&nbsp; paper 
    and pen or pencil.&nbsp; Writing it down and constantly reviewing what 
    you have written is crucial to success.&nbsp; Obtain/do anything that 
    is missing and then follow the action program.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>TONY ROBBINS</b>, in his book Awaken the Giant Within<br>
    (a phrase used in the 1950's by Norman Vincent Peale<br>
    and by Napoleon Hill in the 1930's, and others since),<br>
    and subtitled <br>
  &quot;How to take immediate control of your mental, <br>
    emotional, physical and financial destiny!&quot;,<br>
    He uses a nice line from the past:&nbsp; &quot;Giant goals produce giant 
    motivation,&quot; and echoes what all goal authors state in one way or 
    another:&nbsp; &quot;All GOAL SETTING must be immediately followed by 
    both the development of a plan, and massive and consistent action toward 
    its fulfillment&quot; (p. 275).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    His GOAL SETTING LIST is as follows:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; List categories of your personal and professional 
    life and rate activity in them 5 years ago, today, and what you would 
    like to see take place over the next five years.&nbsp; He urges us to 
    commit to CANNI! (Constant And Never-ending Improvement).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; Specify specifics for the next five years in 
    four areas:&nbsp; personal development, career/business/economic, toys/adventure, 
    and contribution.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>ROBERT A. SCHULLER's LIST FOR GOAL SETTING</b>,<br>
    in If Its Going to Be Its Up To Me (pp. 117-122)<br>
    considers goals to come under the topic commitment.<br>
    Without a commitment to ACT on the goals set,<br>
    the goals remain lifeless on a piece of paper, which is why he says:<br>
  &quot;this could prove to be the most important chapter&quot; in this 
    book.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;Schuller wants us to go beyond &quot;positive thinking&quot; to 
    &quot;possibility thinking.&quot;&nbsp; Here a summary of his 20 point 
    LIST for goal setting, of why Schuller's 20 years of research yields these 
    &quot;20 reasons why a committed goal generates incredible energy&quot;:&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Setting a goal = making a decision = ending indecisiveness<br>
    2.&nbsp; Making a commitment generates and releases enthusiasm<br>
    3.&nbsp; A commitment means you have accepted a challenge, releasing you 
    from apathy<br>
    4.&nbsp; Committing = excellence is targeted and marketed, stifling and 
    rejecting mediocrity<br>
    5.&nbsp; Goal setting asserts leadership; you've taken control<br>
    6.&nbsp; Possibility thinking takes command, as goal setting is an act 
    of putting faith in control of your future<br>
    7.&nbsp; Commitment to goals = you are free to become more than what you've 
    done, free to become more than you are.&nbsp; <br>
    8.&nbsp; Setting and committing to goals renews hope, allows optimism 
    to bloom<br>
    9.&nbsp; Committing connects you with spiritual passion and drive<br>
  &nbsp; 10.&nbsp; Commitment to a goal affirms your personhood, as you 
    move beyond being intimidated by peers or manipulated by society<br>
  &nbsp; 11.&nbsp; Commitment to a goal prevents failure, honors success 
    and, therefore, ensures it<br>
  &nbsp; 12.&nbsp; Commitment to a goal establishes direction and ends the 
    ambiguity's loss of energy <br>
  &nbsp; 13.&nbsp; Commitment enables energy to flow as you overpower (not 
    eliminate) your fears<br>
  &nbsp; 14.&nbsp; Commitment to a goal fixes the focus of your life, ending 
    energy drain by other forces or factors, a now &quot;emotional resources, 
    time resources money resources are now generated, managed, and controlled!&quot;<br>
  &nbsp; 15.&nbsp; Commitment to a goal enables opportunities to become 
    achievements<br>
  &nbsp; 16.&nbsp; Commitment to a goal renews youth, for those with dream 
    aren't old, they are alive<br>
  &nbsp; 17.&nbsp; Commitment connects relationships, expanding and empowering 
    them<br>
  &nbsp; 18.&nbsp; Commitment broadens your power base, strengthening and 
    deepening it<br>
  &nbsp; 19.&nbsp; Commitment = concretizing your priorities, as &quot;Determination 
    is a volcano!&quot; <br>
  &nbsp; 20.&nbsp; Commitment crystallizes your vision when you commit to 
    a dream.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The theme on the Olympic torch is citius (faster), altius (higher), and 
    fortius (stronger)! So, its commitment time.&nbsp; Grab the torch.&nbsp; 
    Set goals and commit to them and watch others marvel at what you can do 
    with your life.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>PETER J. DANIELS<br>
    Ground RULES FOR GOAL SETTERS</b>:<br>
    the Goal Formula, in &quot;How to Reach Your Life Goals,&quot; p. 149<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Rule 1: Clearly define your goals, including major and subordinate 
    goals.<br>
    2.&nbsp; Rule 2: Set out your strategy (which creates energy, saves energy, 
    and gives direction).<br>
    3.&nbsp; Rule 3: Plan out the problems (of which the biggest one is attitude).<br>
    4.&nbsp; Rule 4: Build in Reserves (for your body, mind, and spirit; include 
    financial reserves). <br>
    5.&nbsp; Rule 5: Relate everything to a time frame (fit all goals to set 
    time frames).&nbsp; <br>
    6.&nbsp; Rule 6: Create a master plan (summarize, harmonize, protect progress 
    with checkpoints).<br>
    7.&nbsp; Rule 7: Actionize it now (move beyond theories and knowledge 
    to decisive action).<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    To maintain goals:&nbsp; pay attention to detail, read/affirm your goals 
    daily, expand goals as you go, alter &quot;life style&quot; as necessary 
    to achieve goals, be gracious to others, don't feel guilty about change.&nbsp; 
    Reaffirm the formula by sharing it with others.<br>

  <b>PAUL G. STOLTZ<br>
    Stages for SETTING AND MEETING GOALS&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; (pp. 285-6)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Stage One:&nbsp; Dream the Dream (imagine greater possibilities.&nbsp; 
    &quot;AQ determines what future you allow yourself to even consider.&quot;<br>
    2.&nbsp; Stage Two:&nbsp; Making the Dream the Vision (recognizing the 
    possible realities and sacrifices and setting out to make the climb anyway).<br>
    3.&nbsp; Stage Three:&nbsp; Sustaining the Vision (the most difficult 
    part, but with high AQ, one is able to think past the challenges and take 
    action on the dreams, turning them into visions, and then sustaining the 
    climb until the vision is realized.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>NAPOLEON HILL<br>
    list for GOAL SETTING/planning/action</b><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    In 1908, as a young man, Hill was asked by Andrew Carnegie (then America's 
    richest man) to listen to him speak of his philosophy of success and to 
    then devote twenty years to interviewing the most successful of men and 
    to write about &quot;the philosophy of American achievement.&quot;&nbsp; 
    In 1928, he finished his eight volume The Laws of Success.&nbsp; He became 
    an advisor to Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.&nbsp; 
    In 1937, he published his book Think and Grow Rich (which you could also 
    entitle &quot;The Thoughts and Attitudes and Actions Which Determine Personal 
    and Professional Success&quot;, or &quot;We Are What We Spend Our Time 
    Thinking and Doing and Watching and Listening To.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    Here is Hills's famous recipe for success (p. 36), a LIST of six practical 
    action steps to turn your desires into reality, into the your financial 
    goal (how to turn desires [GOALS] into gold):<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire.<br>
    2.&nbsp; Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money 
    you desire.<br>
    3.&nbsp; Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money 
    you desire. <br>
    4.&nbsp; Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin 
    at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.<br>
    5.&nbsp; Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you 
    intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what 
    you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan 
    through which you intend to accumulate it.<br>
    6.&nbsp; Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before 
    retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning.&nbsp; As you 
    read--see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Recognizing the power of one's thinking <br>
    and of who one associated with, <br>
    Hill LISTS 13 steps to success [to meet GOALS], <br>
    with a whole chapter devoted to each one:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Desire:&nbsp; The Starting Point of all Achievement<br>
    2.&nbsp; Faith:&nbsp; Visualization of and Belief in Attainment of Desire<br>
    3.&nbsp; Autosuggestion:&nbsp; The Medium for Influencing the Subconscious 
    Mind<br>
    4.&nbsp; Specialized Knowledge:&nbsp; Personal Experiences or Observations<br>
    5.&nbsp; Imagination:&nbsp; The Workshop of the Mind<br>
    6.&nbsp; Organized Planning:&nbsp; The Crystallization of Desire into 
    Action<br>
    7.&nbsp; Decision:&nbsp; The Mastery of Procrastination<br>
    8.&nbsp; Persistence:&nbsp; The Sustained Effort Necessary to Induce Faith<br>
    9.&nbsp; Power of the Master Mind: The Driving Mind [Your Invited Advisors 
    and Mentors]<br>
    10.&nbsp; The Mystery of Sex Transmutation [harnessing the drive through 
    &quot;sublimation]<br>
    11.&nbsp; The Subconscious Mind:&nbsp; The Connecting Link<br>
    12.&nbsp; The Brain:&nbsp; A Broadcasting and Receiving Station for Thought<br>
    13.&nbsp; The Sixth Sense:&nbsp; The Door to the Temple of Wisdom<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    In this manner, we can overcome what he calls the &quot;6 Ghosts of Fear&quot; 
    (p. 222:&nbsp; (1) poverty,&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    (2) criticism,&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) ill health,&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) loss of love 
    of someone, &nbsp;&nbsp;(5) old age,&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) death), which he 
    urges the reader to review in order to take inventory of what fears may 
    stand in his or her way.&nbsp; He also LISTS the 31 major causes of failure, </p>
  <p>which the prudent person will review for insights into his or her own 
    situation (pp. 120-126).&nbsp; The 1988 version has an &quot;Action Pack&quot; 
    for achieving success by using it to implement these 13 steps in one's 
    life.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>Another Napoleon Hill <br>
    LIST FOR GOAL SETTING</b><br>
  &nbsp;to acquire one's desires and ambitions in life, <br>
    in his book Succeed and Grow Rich Through Persuasion (p. 28):<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; Define<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    1.&nbsp; Define your goal<br>
    2.&nbsp; Set a positive goal<br>
    3.&nbsp; Plan the means by which to achieve the goal<br>
    4.&nbsp; set out a timetable for the achievement of the goal<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; Write it down<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Write down, right now, a clear outline of every desire 
    for set period of time [1-5 years].<br>
    6.&nbsp; Write down the amount of income desired<br>
    7.&nbsp; Write down what you plan to give to earn this income<br>
    8.&nbsp; Set the amount you intend to acquire each week, each month, and 
    each year<br>
    9.&nbsp; Write down a description of the home you want; put a picture 
    of it where you can see it daily<br>
  &nbsp; 10.&nbsp; Write down a description of the automobile you want and 
    keep a picture of it on your desk.<br>
  &nbsp; 11.&nbsp; If you are no married, write a description of the mate 
    you desire and then write down the qualities you have or intend to acquire 
    to entitle you to the mate you describe<br>
  &nbsp; 12.&nbsp; Make a list of how you intend to use each of the 24 hours 
    of each day, noting you have three time periods, each eight hours, one 
    for sleep, one for business, one for yourself<br>
  &nbsp; 13.&nbsp; Write a description of your occupation, business, or 
    professional calling, select a successful person you know, and set a period 
    of time during which you will become as successful as that person.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; Review and recite<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 14.&nbsp; Set aside one hour a day of your &quot;free time&quot; 
    to reciting that will inspire you to keep your mind positive.&nbsp; Choose 
    material related to your occupation or which in some way will help your 
    career.<br>
  &nbsp; 15.&nbsp; Twice daily, before retiring and after rising, express 
    a prayer of gratitude for your current blessings and for the ones you 
    expect to attain.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp; 16.&nbsp; Carry out the above with enthusiasm, going the extra 
    mile, making alliances with others to achieve your goal, and work with 
    and inspire others to work with what Andrew Carnegie called a &quot;positive 
    mental attitude.&quot; <br>
