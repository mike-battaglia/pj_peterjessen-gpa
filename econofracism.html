  <p> With editing and Appendix of 12/16/92 on &quot;Forum on The Economics 
    of Racism&quot;<br>
    Held by the Metropolitan Council<br>
    at Earle Brown Continuing Education Center<br>
    1890 Buford Avenue, St. Paul Campus<br>
    University of Minnesota<br>
    Wednesday, December 9, 1992</p>
  <p><b
>Forum for: </b>Decisions makers in private, public, and nonprofit sectors</p>
  <p><b
>1st question: </b> what does racism have to do with the economy of the Twin City 
    Metro area?</p>
  <p><b
>2nd question: </b> why the enormous income gap (census figures) between whites 
    and nonwhites?</p>
  <p><b
>Brochure's Proposed solution: </b>education, training, expanded opportunities 
    in the workplace&quot; </p>
  <p><b
>Brief Reponse to Forum Brochure</b></p>
  <p><b
>Yes, this could work IF: </b>you don't kill the <b>geese</b> (industrial capitalism, 
    political democracy, and carefulness/respect for values and tradition) 
    that lay the <b>golden eggs</b> (prosperity, the benefits of material 
    production; equality as access to the ladder of social mobility: to succeed 
    or fail, and if fail, to have a floor below which one doesn't fall; and 
    liberty, in both institutional/political terms and in personal autonomy 
    terms) , all of which contribute to the &quot;of courseness&quot; of the 
    &quot;Multiple Realities of the Everyday World&quot; In The &quot;Contestations&quot; 
    of Social World Building Which Last &quot;Until Further Notice,&quot;<b
> and if this key truth is recognized: racism</b> exists (statistically provable) 
    in both directions, and it is very damaging to our economy, as noted below 
    (and, therefore, it is also damaging to society as a whole, to our sense 
    of shared community and moral standards, and to posterity, the future 
    in which our children and grandchildren will live). Racism works several 
    ways: whites vs. blacks; blacks vs. whites; white ethnics against other 
    white ethnics; different black groups against other black groups; all 
    of which results in a racist culture war in which both white skin heads 
    and black culturalists fight together against the classic liberal, European 
    ideal of tolerance, of people who want to be in the USA in terms of geography, 
    but who are really part of either white or black semi-separatist groups, 
    fighting against being American by culture,<b
> and if change </b>can be facilitated with <b
>civility </b>(also known as what the brochure calls &quot;Minnesota Nice&quot;), 
    upholding <b>both</b> the secular ideals of the <b>enlightenment</b> (of which the minimum is the tolerance of difference, the tolerance of 
    different ideas, and the tolerance of behavior not hurtful of others, 
    where &quot;objectivity&quot; in the analysis of people and their societies 
    is its own reward and <b>the religious ideals</b> of the love and justice 
    teachings of the Judeo-Christian traditions, where the question &quot;who 
    is my brother&quot; is answered by the parable of the &quot;Good Samaritan,&quot; 
    itself the answer to the question &quot;who is my neighbor?&quot;<b
> And finally, </b>if it is understood that by <b>being truly capitalistic, economic 
      activity must be color (and gender) blind</b>, and that civil approaches 
    must not be &quot;Minnesota ICE,&quot; in which non whites (and non-males) 
    are frozen out of the system, out of the process, out of developing, out 
    of managing, and out of owning, often in polite and subtle ways which, 
    nonetheless, are discriminatory due to racism (or gender). In other words, 
    nonwhites (and women) must be allowed to own, must be part of any venue 
    of the powerful and wealthy, including athletic clubs, and must be networked 
    in and elected to political offices as well, <b>if</b> the economy is 
    to truly succeed in the global environment in which it must now work. </p>

>BACKGROUND COMMENTS</b></p>
  <p><b
>Comments About the Contemporary World and USA Scene</b></p>
  <p><b
>World irony #1: </b>Even though racism is being questioned and ended on economic, 
    not moral grounds, racism is being fought in countries only where enlightenment 
    goals are considered valid. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Case in point #1: S. Africa: can't be a modern industrial nation without 
      a mobile, educated work force; ending apartheid is being done on economic 
      grounds first, moral grounds second. This should open our eyes to the 
      need to bring all of our non-white citizens into the ball game as well. 
      Apartheid (racism) is bad for business. </p>
    <p>Case in point #2: this conference: the brochure accurately states that 
      the costs of racism include &quot;nonproductivedeclining tax bases, 
      rising demand for subsidies and serviceshigher numbers of single-parent 
      families, school drop-outs and crimespay more for ineffectual remedies. 
      &quot;But, the brochure leaves out the use of &quot;moral&quot; </p>
    <p>Case in point #3: the key to economics is knowledge; the key to knowledge 
      is education; the key to good education is dollars available for equipment 
      and resources and qualified, experienced teachers; school bussing needs 
      to be seen as a racist victory of those willing to give a little to 
      keep a lot: the unwillingness to give control of the money for education 
      to the non-whites. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b
>World irony #2: racism</b> is now <b>the</b> <b>solution of choice</b> where 
    Communism <b
>and</b> the Enlightenment (or just the enlightenment in countries which were 
    not communist) are/ is being repealed by the new convergence of religion 
    and nationalism. Our continued &quot;do nothing response&quot; (until 
    CNN forces otherwise) reflects an acceptance of racism in the political 
    calculations of others and, therefore, in our own, and worse, legitimating 
    it with religion. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Case in point #1: Ethnic cleansing in what used to be called Yugoslavia</p>
    <p>Case in point #2: An Azerbaijani leader on the Armenian question: &quot;emulate 
      Stalin and Hitler&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #3: A Bulgarian scholar: &quot;new forms of backwardness,&quot; 
      due to the alliance of Bulgarian chauvinism with restored authority 
      of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church</p>
    <p>Case in point #4: In Tadjikistan and Soviet Central Asia, &quot;Islamic 
      fundamentalists are forcing educated Westernized women to resume their 
      proper place within the Shari'a, total submission to patriarchal authority, 
      confinement to the home, wearing of special dress, dictated by men. </p>
    <p>Case in point #5: The Hindus vs. the Muslims in India</p>
    <p>Case in point #6: The Protestant Christians vs. the Roman Catholic 
      Christians in Ireland</p>
    <p>Case in point #7: The right wing Christians in the U. S. vs. all other 
      non-agreeing U. S. Christians </p>
    <p>Case in point #8: The South in the U. S. before WWII, and added in 
      the North after WWII, and the continued difficulties in passing civil 
      rights laws in the post-cold war era. </p>
    <p>Case in point #9: &quot;The white separatist movement will not be stopped 
      in the puny town of Portland. We're in your colleges, we're in your 
      armies, we're in your police forces, we're in your technical areas. 
      We've planted the seeds. &quot;Tom Metzger, White Aryan Resistance. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> </p>
  <p><b
>World irony #3: </b> Anti-communists of Eastern Europe have had to help us revive 
    our faith in democracy in the late 80's after many lost faith in the U. 
    S. and democracy in the 1970's. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Case in point #1: William Ophuls: &quot;Leviathan or Oblivion?&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #2: Robert Heilbroner: we need &quot;iron government&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #3: Garrett Harden: we need &quot;mutual coercion mutually 
      agreed upon&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #4: Samuel Huntington: &quot;democracy is too expensive&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #5: Arnold Toynbee: &quot;In all developed countries, 
      a new way of life, a severely regimented way of life, will have to be 
      imposed by a ruthless authoritarian government.&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #6: Wallerstein: The solution is to replace capitalism 
      with &quot;world wide democratic socialism&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #7: Headline: &quot;A crowded world: can mankind survive 
      in freedom?&quot;</p>
    <p>Case in point #8: India, 1975: democracy as &quot;a threat to human 
      rights everywhere; authoritarianism: &quot;necessary to preserve freedom 
      and democracy&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> </p>
  <p><b
>World irony #4: </b>The global economy idea is no joke: it is a vast reality; 
    and in the quest for corporate profits, companies, not governments, are 
    bringing higher standards of living to the poorest places in the world, 
    as they raise standards in one country they leave to find a poorer place, 
    and begin to raise their standards as well (so: why not in the poor areas 
    of the Twin Cities or any other urban poor area?). </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Case in point #1: Few major products, regardless of where assembled, 
      have their components made 100% in the same country, even those &quot;made 
      in America&quot;. </p>
    <p>Case in point #2: When labor costs were too high in the USA, US companies 
      sent manufacturing abroad to Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. Now, because 
      of high labors costs there, they are sending their manufacturing to 
      Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Mexico, Latin America, etc. </p>
    <p>Case in point #3: Twin city workers in some manufacturing are making 
      $5/hour. Some who make $7 or more/hour feel they are doing great, given 
      the reality of their low education and the recession. With the appropriate 
      mix of tax laws, incentives for production and manufacturing using the 
      latest in technology and total control management, disincentives for 
      polluting, and incentives for training (all of which could reduce the 
      cost of manufacturing and even provide for some wage increases) , this 
      same dynamic can be used to raise people out of poverty in the inner 
      cities and other low value land areas/neighborhoods of the cities. </p>
    <p>Case in point #4: Los Angeles! (two of the four corners at Pico and 
      Alvarado where I used to sell newspapers as a teenager are burned to 
      the ground). To keep L. A. from becoming the &quot;ghost of Christmas 
      future,&quot; a different approach is needed to deal with the Twin Cities' 
      version of the urban crisis. Given the high proportion of nonwhites 
      in poorer urban areas, non-white communities have both a right and a 
      responsibility to attempt to bring the problem to resolution. BUT, to 
      be truly effective, it must be done on the basis of the geography-poverty 
      level, not on the basis of race. The economics of racism for L. A. has 
      spawned &quot;Shining Path&quot; (Peru's guerrilla organization, one 
      of the bloodiest in the world) &quot;wannabees&quot; among gangs (note 
      that in closed, non-English speaking communities, revolution and communism 
      lack the sigma they carry elsewhere in the United States). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b
>Consider this truth: </b>&quot;You become what you hate. &quot; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Case in point #1: Serbs, killed by Croats in WWII, are now killing 
      the Croats. </p>
    <p>Case in point #2: Jews, as 2nd class citizens prior to the establishment 
      of the state of Israel, have made Palestinians second class citizens. </p>
    <p>Case in point #3: Prior oppressed U. S. A. minorities now want other 
      minorities oppressed in their favor. </p>
    <p>Case in point #4: Reliance on the Plantation shifted to reliance on 
      the government. </p>
    <p>Case in point #5: Conservatives disliking government &quot;personal 
      welfare&quot; payments don't mind receiving government &quot;corporate 
      welfare&quot; payments. </p>
    <p>Case in point #6: People who have &quot;made it&quot; to the suburbs 
      are now practicing drawbridge ethics against both people and societal 
      services: NIMBY: not in my backyard. </p>
    <p>Case in point #7: The Twin Cities should be looking to set the example 
      of developing a national urban agenda which would include the twin investment 
      themes of the President-elect: <b>infrastructure investment</b> (roads, 
      bridges, sewers, etc. ) <b>and</b> human<b> </b>capital investment (Head-Start, 
      including pre-and post-, pre-natal care, health care program, etc.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> </p>
  <b
>Also consider these &quot;truths&quot;: </b>
  <p><b>(1) </b>human nature is a social construction (a clue for sociobiologists: 
    self reflection); </p>
  <p><b
>(2) </b>without a moral consensus, society will swing wildly between anarchy 
    and despotism; </p>
  <p><b
>(3) </b>no positive change can happen without choice (choice comes from the word 
    that means &quot;heresy&quot;) : the future = choice = policy options; </p>
  <p><b
>(4) </b>all social/political actions lead to unintended consequences; </p>
  <p><b
>(5) </b>racism is empirically verifiable statistically (ditto prejudice against 
    women, others) </p>
  <p><b
>(6) </b>Christianity is about love. Racism is not about love. Many of &quot;World 
    Ironies 1 &amp; 2&quot; above are Christian. Yet: 70% of Christians in 
    the world today live in 3rd world countries. White Christians &quot;don't 
    get it&quot; that the &quot;European Captivity&quot; of Christianity has 
    long been over and that their Christian brothers and sisters are third 
    worlders. Racism by Christians is untenable on all grounds. The historical 
    Jesus, whatever else he was, put his accent on compassion for the poor 
    and oppressed and stressed that the Kingdom of God was an alternative 
    to what we, in our words, would call &quot;the idolization of wealth, 
    prestige, group loyalty, and power,&quot; as he exercised his &quot;rude, 
    raw, and authentic&quot; honesty and fearlessness. &quot;Hence, a &quot;Christian 
    nation&quot; would elect preferential options for the poor minorities 
    of the inner cities. </p>
  <p  'tab-stops: 2. 0in'><b>An alternative perspective: </b>the issue is, 
    thus, <b>more</b> than race: it is the clash between group identities 
    and individual identities and classes and cultures/sub-cultures, due to 
    the <b>dread and fear of diversity and difference,</b> resulting in the 
    tolerance of <b
>poverty </b>(the price willing to be paid to prevent diversity) , because of 
    faulty (at best) and evil (at worst) <b>visions</b> of the nature <b>of 
      humans</b> and <b
>of society</b> and the responses as to what to do about both. We need to move 
    beyond the false reality of &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; to the empirical 
    reality of &quot;interculturalism,&quot; of the constant &quot;cognitive 
    contamination&quot; that takes place despite efforts, by whoever, at retaining 
    &quot;purity,&quot; and recognize and celebrate the contributions of <b>both</b> dead white males on one hand and live black males and live black and white 
    females on the other. Objectively and historically speaking, either/or 
    is incorrect, both/and <b
>is</b> correct. </p>
  <p  'tab-stops: 2. 0in'><b>Alternative</b> <b
>discussion points that impact on racism: </b></p>
  <p ><b
>(1) </b>seek an understanding of the relationship between economic development 
    and sociocultural change that occurs regardless of race, recognizing that 
    the key phenomenon, therefore, is not the concepts of &quot;race&quot; 
    or &quot;racism,&quot; but the concept of &quot;modernity,&quot; and the 
    relationship between cultural values (which includes racism) and economics, 
    and the understanding of what is <b>intrinsic</b> to modernity and not 
    changeable, and <b>extrinsic</b>, and therefore changeable; </p>
  <p ><b
>(2) </b>seek a balance between the formulation and application of what almost 
    everyone and every group wants at least for themselves and/or their group: 
    &quot;love&quot; and &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;, 
    and seek to understand how an imbalance in these creates the imbalance 
    in economics; </p>
  <p ><b

    commitment, inspire people, revitalize organizations, and mobilize resources 
    needed to turn vision into reality (perform &quot;vision audits&quot;) 
    : you lead people, you manage things. For both to work, you need vision. 
    Every one of the reasons given for why Bush lost the election can be traced 
    to his &quot;I'm not into the vision thing. &quot;That meant that none 
    of his people could be either. Likewise, Carter had no vision while in 
    office. Like Bush, both believed they should be President because they 
    were capable, better than the others running, or fulfilling a destiny, 
    not because they had any particular goal regarding society micro (the 
    U. S. A. ) or macro (the world). Both Reagan and Clinton are into the 
    vision thing. The debate in America today is not so much a culture war 
    (although there are elements of one) as it is a clash regarding the model 
    to follow for processing and acting in society for, governments and corporations, 
    for families and individuals, for income gaining and wealth making. Whether 
    and how that takes place will depend upon the model chosen (or, in the 
    U. S. , the model that is &quot;turned loose&quot; when a new President 
    is elected). </p>
  <p>A realistic vision would be a &quot;partnership model&quot;; government 
    as part of the solution, as a catalyst; a free market with rules; a culture 
    of interdependence; invest and grow balance-ism; innovative pubic spending

    6: 8: &quot;He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the 
    Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk 
    humbly with your God?&quot; I John 3: 17: &quot;How does God's love abide 
    in anyone who has the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need 
    and yet refuses help?&quot;Langston Hughes: &quot;A long time ago, an 
    enslaved people heading toward freedom made up a song: <i>Keep Your Hand 
      on the Plow!Hold On!</i>That plow plowed a new furrow across the field 
    of history. Into that furrow the freedom seed was dropped. From that seed 
    a tree grew, is growing, will ever grow. That tree is for everybody, for 
    all America, for all the world. May its branches spread and its shelter 
    grow until all races and all peoples know its shade. &quot; </p>
  <p>Real discrimination and real integration are neither racial nor ethnic. 
    Real discrimination is in the area of power and wealth. Monopolies and 
    oligarchies discriminate on two things and two things only: power and 
    wealth. The racial and ethnic questions depend on which country or nation 
    or company or organization one is in. The history of the world is of discrimination 
    of the powerful and wealthy against the non-powerful and non-wealthy. 
    Here, they were &quot;equal opportunity discriminators&quot;equally against 
    all others, regardless of race, religion, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
    etc. , who were not in their circle who controlled power and wealth. </p>

  <p><b
>T</b><b>he following action program combines collaboratively</b> the private 
    sector, the public sector (government) , the not-for profit sector (tax 
    exempt organizations, churches, charities, etc. ) , and the education/ 
    training sector (public, private, not-for-profit) in economic activity/construction/business/ 
    manufacturing/services that will create growth and development, and the 
    training and opportunities to make it happen, and the profits and jobs 
    that will come as a result </p>
  <p>I am suggesting that the Metropolitan Council consider being <b>either 
    the</b> catalyst or coordinator <b>or</b> &quot;matchmaker&quot; to bring 
    into being a special planning and operating group charged with the task <b>(</b>comprised of representatives for appointees of, say, <b>both</b> the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs <b>and</b> the Center 
    for the American Experiment, <b>along with</b> representatives of appointees 
    of an inner city community development group<b>) </b>of getting this 
    project of investment-production, service, training, and community activities 
    off the ground, on a site which will have four types of institutional 
    interaction, which would include <b>(1) </b> private sector investment, 
    manufacturing production and related operations activities, service firms, <b>(2) </b>public sector and <b>(3) </b>not-for profitcommunity activities, 
    and <b
>(4) </b>joint ventures. These four sectors would be housed in a center, or in 
    several connecting centers not far from each other, and from this would 
    come the reinvigoration of this part (or part, if more than one site is 
    established) of the city and its inhabitants, while at the same time addressing 
    real economic and job needs of both the cities and the suburbs (some workers 
    would be from the inner city, some would commute in from the suburbs. </p>
  <p><b
>1. </b>Multi-economic enterprises: the <b
>private sector. </b>This could be part of the 3rd Reconstruction. Instead of 
    shipping factories and jobs overseas, use investment and other credits 
    along with labor and wage agreements to facilitate such &quot;off shore-like&quot; 
    and &quot;overseas-like expansion&quot; to take place poverty areas, so 
    that the investment, jobs, training, etc. , go into the economic hell 
    holes of our cities, not the cities overseas. This goes beyond the mere 
    &quot;enterprise zones&quot; concept which is exclusive, which again ghettoizes 
    the inner cities, making them enterprises for outside owners, and facilitates 
    making neighborhoods dependent on the enterprises, not interdependent 
    with their people moving toward self sufficiency. Another mechanism would 
    be to have joint ventures, so that outsiders could start slowly to test 
    the waters, but do so with the local population behind the project. </p>
  <p><b
>2. </b>Multi-services: the <b
>government sector</b>. Build on the very successful and expanded Section 703 
    of the House and Urban Development Act of 1965 (Neighborhood Facilities 
    Grant Program) , authorizing the establishment of neighborhood Multi-Service 
    Centers (New York City is successfully involved in this program). </p>
  <p><b
>3. </b>Multi-training enterprises/services/activities: a <b>joint venture/partnership</b> between the government, private, and not-for-profit sectors. What better 
    place to bring together those involved in training, particularly job training, 
    than these new inner city areas of investment?In one location you have 
    the enterprises, the workers, the housing, the schools, and the training. 
    This could include public schools, GED, vocational-technical schools, 
    community colleges, other adult training, etc. </p>
  <p><b
>4. &nbsp;</b>Multi-activities: the <b>not-for-profit world </b>of community 
    organizations, community development organizations, neighborhood groups, 
    charities, foundations, churches (with different religions and/or denominations 
    sharing spaces) , etc. We know, historically, every society needs strong 
    communities which support families and allow freedom of worship. Thus, 
    with this suggestion, these needs are addressed as well. </p>
  <p> <b
>5. </b>Existing Programs: Inner city development and business</p>
  <p> Proposed National Service Corps</p>
  <p> City Year Program now in place in Boston</p>
  <p> Enterprise Zones which are inclusive, not exclusive </p>
  <p>Just as Lincoln &quot;corrected&quot; the constitution (which allowed 
    slavery) by re-interpreting it through the lens of the Declaration of 
    Independence (Gettysburg address: &quot;all are created equal&quot;) , 
    which corrected the social side of things, this type of approach, using 
    the same technique, can use Lincoln's notions of unity and nationhood 
    to &quot;correct&quot; the reconstruction of the 19th century which did 
    not follow his outline once he was assassinated (part of that &quot;correction 
    came during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's; now we have to complete 
    that &quot;correction&quot;) by now adding to the social side the economic 
    side. </p>
  <p>It behooves us in the Twin Cities to establish our own project before 
    one is established for us. The above adds good new ideas to good old ones, 
    and is inclusive on all fronts: investment and development, business and 
    government, jobs and training, non-profits and not-for-profits, race and 
    ethnicity, income and class, while still taking a &quot;lets make haste 
    slowly&quot; approach to test them out. Lets test them out to show they 
    will work. The suburbs won't be safe until the cities are. And the country 
    has no real future until all the citizens have a future. You can't have 
    growth and development and be an industrial super power for long (let 
    alone &quot;at all&quot;) , unless all of the population is engaged, a 
    population that is educated and mobile. Doing so would end the negative 
    economics of racism, and include all into the American Dream. </p>
  <p><b

    society, to improve upon Jefferson's project of &quot;Inventing America,&quot; 
    as the books listed below clearly demonstrate. It is important to note 
    that most of these are very recent. The Metropolitan Council can lead 
    the way to this reconstruction n the Twin Cities. These titles also demonstrate 
    the nuances and shades of meaning and honest differences of opinion or 
    perspective of honorable people. They also reflect what happens when our 
    social cohesion is lessened when civility, morals, common sense, and law 
    order either dissolve or are abandoned. </p>
  <p>We need the will (political will, economic will, corporate will, personal 
    will) to deal with both the ideas and the empirical facts, to extract 
    from them what we need, and to use them as our building blocks for building 
    the economic powerhouse and social peace in the minds of all of us, doing 
    so &quot;objectively&quot; on clearly understood values, not in some blind 
    ideological manner. During our first hundred years, we saw ourselves the 
    opposite of the old world and its sins. In the second hundred years we 
    became an advanced model of the old world. In our third century, will 
    we generate the inner resolve to see ourselves as different from the Third 
    World and its sins, or will we become an advanced model of them as well? </p>
  <p>Ideas and programs should be approached like manufacturing, seeking a 
    balance between TQM, JIT, and ZDM (Total Quality Management, Just In Time 
    delivery, and Zero Defects Management). The following list is by no means 
    exhaustive; but it certainly is instructive. The reader could add from 
    his or her favorites. Finally, most of these are not scholarly works, 
    but rather popular works based on scholarly undertakings. </p>
