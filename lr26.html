  <p><b>26.&nbsp; LIST for Personal Time Management and Cooperative Team Building 
    E Pluribus Unum:&nbsp;&nbsp; out of many, one:&nbsp; It takes ALL of you 
    to make you One!</b><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Peter J. Jessen<br>
    Wilson High School Leadership Group, December 2 &amp; 9, 1998<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Theme:&nbsp; Working As A Team<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Managing Time is possible:&nbsp;&nbsp; make lists, keep a calendar.&nbsp; 
    Managing people is more difficult.&nbsp; In one sense, you manage things 
    but only lead people (in Harry Bredemeier's phrase, we have the&nbsp; 
    sovereignty/coordination problem:&nbsp; how to coordinate inter-dependent 
    role players (actors, individuals) in the teeth of their autonomy.&nbsp; 
    How can we lead each other &amp; still have teamwork?&nbsp; How do we 
    handle our various meetings (from large group to small)?&nbsp; How do 
    we reconcile the group's AND each person's sovereignty?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here 
    are 12 statements to consider for being better stewards of time, talents, 
    and treasury (bold = a book title):&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; We need rules of procedures that we add Riddick's Rules 
    of Procedure to that of Roberts'.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 2. We recognize the importance of an agenda and then follow the 
    agenda format adopted, along with accompanying assignment charts (or lists) 
    AND calendar charts, including meeting agreed upon deadlines.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 3.&nbsp; We need to work more as a team and utilize our time in 
    getting together to build positive relationships getting to yes by communicating 
    openly and &quot;unconditionally constructive&quot;.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Let's spread our teamwork throughout the school following 
    the principles that will enable us to win friends and influence people, 
    not make enemies and divide the team.&nbsp; Make this part of our following 
    the 7 habits of highly effective teens.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Let's follow the principles of the one minute manager 
    to set and meet goals, to praise each other and, as required, to reprimand.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Let's anticipate each other better and not take actions 
    that end teamwork.&nbsp; Let's be careful to make sure that we follow 
    conduct expected (which means roles:&nbsp; you can't live a role free 
    existence, so don't break role).&nbsp;&nbsp; What is expected?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 7.&nbsp; As school leaders, let's exercise leadership that &quot;endures 
    in a changing world&quot; by turning to each other and saying, &quot;lead 
    on&quot;, not just &quot;follow me.&quot;&nbsp; Be positive and constructive.&nbsp; 
    Will we deal with the &quot;hard facts&quot; without being hard on each 
    other?&nbsp; Will we put data over hunches/experience?<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 8.&nbsp; That we always remember that we are not discussing some 
    new &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different,&quot; and that the simple is 
    not always simplistic; thus we must all be able to say that all I really 
    need to know I learned in kindergarten, where we first learned uncommon 
    thoughts on common things.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; 9.&nbsp; That time management is an act of personal and organizational 
    stewardship, and that in following the notion of first things first, in 
    order to have principle centered leadership, so that we can transcend 
    the ordinary so that we can have &quot;constant energy&quot;, &quot;thought 
    power&quot;, &quot;believe in ourselves&quot; (the heart of teamwork), 
    generate an &quot;inflow of new thoughts which can re-make us&quot;, &quot;create 
    our own happiness&quot;, &quot;break the worry habit&quot; and &quot;solve 
    personal problems&quot;.&nbsp; In taking responsibility, ask:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &quot;Am I confident that this is the way I want to invest my time and 
    life?&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    10.&nbsp; That in the sense that we represent the corporate body of our 
    school, we must not forget that it will take teamwork to enable us to 
    be able to engage in climbing the corporate Matterhorn, the secret for 
    successful climbing being the continuing of our education so we know more, 
    not less, and that it enable us to more carefully and thoughtfully delegate 
    the work and tasks in order to share the load in true teamwork fashion.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    11.&nbsp; Following these 12 points shows emotional intelligence, which 
    is needed if we are to have a high enough adversity quotient, to enable 
    turning obstacles into opportunities, as we stress for success through 
    learned optimism, joyfully engaging full catastrophe living, which is 
    why zebras don't get ulcers. &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    12.&nbsp; KEY #1:&nbsp; &nbsp;L-I-S-T-S&nbsp; (in #'s 1-11; need time 
    lines to be effective).&nbsp; Learn/understand the key dynamics of social 
    change (source of uncertainty; the only constant) and social roles.&nbsp; 
    KEY #2:&nbsp; &nbsp;c-o-l-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-I-o-n (which you can't have unless 
    all is NEGOTIABLE) as opposed to just accommodation, avoidance, controlling, 
    or compromise.&nbsp; Hannah Arendt: meet &quot;the irreversibility of 
    human actions and words&#147; with &quot;the power to forgive.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Solve the chaos of &#147;unpredictability [with] the power of promise.&#148; 
    Interact with civility, avoid any false pyramid of sacrifice.&nbsp; Love 
    kindness, do justice, walk humbly.&nbsp; Debunk boys will be boys and 
    help in (reviving Ophelia) rescuing the lives of adolescent girls.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Mark Twain:</p>
  <p>Inherently, each one of us has the substance within to achieve whatever 
    our goals and dreams define.&nbsp; What is missing from each of us is 
    the training, education, knowledge and insight to utilize what we already 
    have.&quot;</p>
  <p>Thomas Huxley, British biologist<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make 
    yourself to do the thing you have to do when it ought to be done whether 
    you like it or not.&nbsp; It is the first lesson that ought to be learned 
    and however early a person's training begins, it is probably the last 
    lesson a person learns thoroughly.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Peter L. Berger:&nbsp; Reality is of course........until further notice. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Sandra Scarr:&nbsp; Opportunity breads predestination.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Caveat:&nbsp; leadership applies anywhere, to any system, any group, whether 
    democratic (decisions determined by vote) or authoritative (not direct 
    voting, although many listen to input).&nbsp; Many institutions, by definition, 
    cannot be.&nbsp; Many situations require authorities (parenting, coaching, 
    teaching, combat, etc.).&nbsp; In others we vote for our leaders and either 
    follow them or have them submit their decisions to us for a vote.&nbsp; 
    You cannot vote on truth.&nbsp; You cannot vote on how much 2 + 2 equals.&nbsp; 
    And much that we hold to be true is our truth but not THE truth.&nbsp; 
    BUT:&nbsp; you can negotiate with authority regarding &quot;climate&quot; 
    and areas of their responsibility that deal with you.</p>
  <p>Hence the even greater need for collaboration and exercising your leadership 
    with positive action.</p>
