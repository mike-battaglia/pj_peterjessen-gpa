  <p align="center">From:&nbsp;Peter Jessen<br>
    Emailed October 08, 2001 <br>
  </p>
  <p>Key question:&nbsp; &#147;Why aren&#146;t the Fortune 500 of the Twin 
    Cities supporting the area's #1 team, the area&#146;s favorite team, as 
    sponsors?&#148;</p>
  <p>This question still haunts.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; particularly apt when one 
    considers the myth in the Twin Cities and Minnesota, expressed in different 
    articles, that four teams cannot be supported.&nbsp; Given the legislature's 
    attempts to provide a baseball stadium, the establishment of the basketball 
    arena, and the new arena for hockey, it is almost as if everyone has decided 
    that the Vikings have to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that the legislature 
    send a clear signal that this is on dog it won't send out to hunt, that 
    this is one train on which it is not riding.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if it is 
    on board with that, then it also needs to tell its constituents that such 
    is the case, and then let them decide from their response whether they 
    are in agreement with you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for Gophers only fans, Minnesota 
    would be very upset to learn of this belief about the Vikings, and would 
    rise up and urge the two sides to work it out so that the Vikings can 
    say.</p>
  <p>I noted earlier that due to the attacks of 9-11, I would delay in sending 
    the attached materials. With our counter-attack underway, this is a good 
    time to resume the discussion.&nbsp; American has business to attend to 
    in terms of the War on Terrorism.&nbsp; American also yearns for normalcy, 
    to get back to the same old routines.&nbsp;&nbsp; That will be impossible.&nbsp; 
    And yet the sports teams of cities provide their fans, city/state/nation 
    wide a respite from this seriious business at hand.&nbsp; One could say 
    that professional sports are needed even more, given the task at hand, 
    its duration, and its seriousness.&nbsp; What better relief each week 
    of the&nbsp; Fall than respite with the NFL, and then later during the 
    Winter with the NBA and then with MLB in the Spring and Summer?&nbsp; 
    And then there is also soccer, hockey, and other sports and interests.</p>
  <p>Extracts taken from a series of articles from Forbes.com re the 31 stadiums 
    (&lt;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/17/nfl_5.html">http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/17/nfl_5.html</a>&gt;). 
    Vikings are ranked #29 out of 31.&nbsp; The major difference between theVikings 
    and the other 3 lowest rank teams is that the other three (#'s 28, 30, 
    31) have low fan support.&nbsp; The Vikings have great fan support.&nbsp; 
    But, and this is the key question of the attachment on NFL stadiums, even 
    though all of the new stadiums are tax payer supported in part, the articles 
    says &quot;Taxpayers showing no suport for new stadium.&quot; But what 
    the article really finds unbelievable is the situation it raises in this 
    question:</p>
  <p>This issue of Fortune has excellent biz ops suggestions/ideas that any 
    team can benefit from, and use them to add to the 40 ways in 26 categories 
    to generate revenues outlined in the Generic Model I submitted to you 
    August 10th.&nbsp; It might be useful to survey what all the other teams 
    are doing and take that info, plus select from the 40 suggestions in my 
    stadium proposal, re additional ways, NOW, that the Vikings can generate 
    more revenue, as a way to move more closely to resolving the underlying 
    issues.&nbsp; The attachments on stadium suites demonstrates how they 
    help the team.&nbsp; In light of the 1986 Federal law suggesting only 
    10% of revenues from stadiums go to cities/regions, it would appear that 
    these attached articles point toward compromise, ways in which both team 
    and state can come together to use a partial amount of stadium revenues 
    to help fund the amount the Vikings had hoped would be covered by the 
    half cent tax on motels and hotels.&nbsp; In this way, the stadium issue 
    is solved, no new tax dollars are used, as the stadium could thus be built 
    under current statues without needing to go to the legislature.&nbsp; 
    But certainly the legislature could help mediate this difference, help 
    close the gap, and help get the stadium project back on track.</p>
  <p>Again, any way in which I can help, let me know.&nbsp; That goes for 
    Otis Courtney and www.vikingsstadium.com as well.</p>

  <p>NFL Caters to Box Holders With Porcupines, Psychics, Bands Reprinted 
    with permission of Bloomberg News</p>
  <p>New York -- From traveling zoos and psychics to golf outings and trips 
    to the Super Bowl, National Football League teams are willing to do almost 
    anything to please their luxury suite owners.</p>
  <p>That's no surprise considering that the posh stadium boxes lease for 
    as much as $300,000 a year and their wealthy owners -- mostly businesses 
    -- have so many other ways to spend their entertainment dollars.</p>
  <p>Revenue from luxury suites can reach $14 million a year for the 29 of 
    31 teams that get it, and -- unlike most other money a team generates 
    -- doesn't have to be shared with the rest of the league. That's plenty 
    of incentive for teams to be extra attentive to the people in the boxes.</p>
  <p>&quot;You can't just lease them a suite for 10 games and say, `We'll 
    see you next year,' because you might not,'' said Dennis Mannion, the 
    Baltimore Ravens' vice president of marketing. &quot;This is an exclusive 
    club, where helping you improve your business and make new friends is 
    our top priority.''</p>
  <p>The suites often include televisions, bars, refrigerators and sound systems. 
    Owners can use them anytime, even when there's no game, for any function 
    ranging from entertaining customers to hosting a family reunion.</p>
  <p>Suite owners include big corporations like FedEx Corp. and closely held 
    companies like ACCU Staffing Services in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.</p>
  <p>NFL teams want to make sure that their clients feel they are getting 
    their money's worth, so they stage social events and try to foster business 
    connections.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's the next wave of suite marketing,'' Mannion said. &quot;I 
    think you really have to be able to show these people how they can use 
    this resource more effectively to improve their revenue and business contacts.''</p>
  <p>The Philadelphia Eagles, for example, try to keep their suite holders 
    happy by scheduling events during the spring and summer. Since the Phillies 
    also play at Veterans Stadium, Eagles suite holders get season tickets 
    for the baseball team, too.</p>
  <p>This spring, Ron Frickle of the Philadelphia Zoo brought his &quot;Zoo 
    on Wheels'' program to the stadium. Frickle, the zoo's senior director 
    of education, entertained box holders with boa constrictors, lizards, 
    parrots and porcupines.</p>
  <p>Another night, the Greater Kensington String Band, which performs in 
    Philadelphia's annual Mummers Parade, went from box to box playing such 
    standards as &quot;Golden Slippers.'' The Eagles even brought in local 
    psychic Susan Samans to visit families in the suites.</p>
  <p>&quot;The kids were pre-teen and into dating, and I would tell them whether 
    a guy was right or wrong for them,'' Samans said. &quot;The adults were 
    more into business deals.''</p>
  <p>Outside the stadium, there are team-sponsored softball tournaments, a 
    touch football tournament, a dinner cruise on the Delaware River, and 
    a question-and-answer luncheon with coach Andy Reid and owner Jeffrey 
    Lurie during training camp.</p>
  <p>&quot;All these activities add value to the relationship with our suite 
    holders,'' said Len Komoroski, the Eagles' senior vice president of business 
    operations. &quot;When it comes time to renew, hopefully you won't want 
    to leave your friends or miss all these great things we're doing.''</p>
  <p>Doris Damm, president of ACCU Staffing Services, said the add-ons are 
    nice, but her company uses the suite mostly to entertain clients during 
    baseball and football games.</p>
  <p>She said she's been able to track 15 percent of company's revenue to 
    sales made in the suite, so her company will pay $165,000 a year for a 
    suite in the Eagles' new stadium when it opens in 2003. That's up from 
    $110,000 at Veteran's Stadium, and the new stadium won't include the Phillies 
    games because the baseball team is getting its own ballpark.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's a chance to schmooze a little and let your customers get to 
    know you as a person rather than as sales call,'' Damm said. &quot;It 
    also lets them tell you what you're doing right and wrong, in a more relaxed 
    atmosphere.''</p>
  <p>Other NFL teams are also going out of their way to entertain suite holders.</p>
  <p>The Georgia Dome in Atlanta -- which operates the boxes at the stadium 
    and keeps the revenue from them -- arranges for suite owners to play golf 
    on some of the state's finest private courses. The Detroit Lions are the 
    only other NFL team that doesn't receive suite income.</p>
  <p>&quot;Our people tend to like nice things, but they like it all prepared 
    for them so they can just write the check and enjoy themselves,'' said 
    Mark Giles, executive services manager for the Georgia Dome.</p>
  <p>In Baltimore, the Ravens are creating a computer system for suite holders 
    so they can communicate with each other during games. There are also technology 
    nights where the latest gadgets are on display, an exclusive line of merchandise 
    for suite users, and free trips to the Super Bowl.</p>
  <p>Rich Inman, vice president of closely held James Tower in North Mankato, 
    Minnesota, leases a software program called SuiteBOSS.com to help suite 
    holders make better use of their luxury boxes.<br>
    The program, which costs between $12,000 and $20,000 a year, helps companies 
    keep track of which salespeople are using the suites. It can also be used 
    to buy additional tickets and order concessions.</p>
  <p>&quot;A lot of organizations look at the money and say, `This is a lot 
    for client entertainment. How do I justify this?''' Inman said. &quot;A 
    lot of stadiums are working to help them answer that question.''</p>
