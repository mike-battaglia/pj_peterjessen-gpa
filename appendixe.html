        Player Compensation Section, II.B.</b></p>
            <p>&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over all goals:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              1.#1 from which all other follow:&nbsp; to protect and enhance the goose 
              that lays the golden eggs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; To obtain wealth building 
              without wealth busting for players/coaches/owner<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; To increase the brand recognition 
              and brand building of the team&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; 
              To keep the best players, despite free agency, by meeting the challenge 
              of developing new stars and follow the model to keep them with the team 
              when they become free agents.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; To keep all stakeholders 
              and constituencies happy and satisfied<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; To avoid the strike damaging 
              action that is in baseball&#146;s future<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; To avoid &#147;second season 
              only&#148; viewing of the NBA<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; To become an &#147;experiment&#148; 
              for the team&#146;s league if the league isn&#146;t sure about adopting 
              some of these ingredients of our recipe for success league wide.&nbsp; 
              This is OK.&nbsp; The team will greatly benefit from being the early adopter.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Goals of the various stakeholders and constituencies:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1).. Player goals: to 
              maximize income, especially signing bonuses, to have a great &#147;crib,&#148; 
              to survive economically if they encounter career ending injuries, support 
              entourages, earn &#147;respect&#148; for themselves, play on a championship 
              team.&nbsp; In addition:&nbsp; never have their legs worked out from under 
              them, have their safety and health paramount and thus not get rushed back 
              in prematurely after an injury, and have an appropriate training program 
              to get them back to playing condition as soon as possible after an injury.&nbsp; 
              Hence, they want long term incentives for short term career windows.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2).. Coach goals: to 
              maximize ability to sign or not sign players, retain or let go players, 
              according to what the team needs to build, minimally, a competitive team 
              and, maximally, a championship team (achieve excellence in play, not mediocrity).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3).. Owner goals: to 
              maximize investment, keep players and fans happy, not lose players to 
              free agency and still stay within a spending discipline (the &#147;salary 
              cap&#148;), and do so without having to go into tremendous debt or risk 
              financial red ink, all the while developing a championship team.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4).. Investor goals:&nbsp; 
              to earn a significant return on investment (with appropriate patience 
              and exit strategy), prestige, attend training camp, meet players, watch 
              games in the team private suite, and be part of a championship team.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5).. Fan goals: to have 
              their heroes play &#147;forever&#148; and bring home a championship and 
              have local bragging rights.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6).. TV goals:&nbsp; 
              to have top viewing ratings, both in the U.S. and world wide.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7).. Advertiser goals:&nbsp; 
              to maximize exposure of message(s) to as many target demographics as possible.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8).. Employee goals 
              of companies doing business with or because of the team&nbsp; (whether 
              large or small firm, whether directly or indirectly involved):&nbsp; to 
              be productive in whatever product or service is made or provided that 
              is related to the team, directly or indirectly, and to be part of a championship 
              season.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9).. Government goals 
              (state, counties, cities):&nbsp;&nbsp; to maximize revenues over the long 
              term, bask in the team&#146;s reflected glory, and have bragging rights 
              that come from not only having a team, but also from having a division, 
              conference and/or league championship.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10).. Note the common goal of all:&nbsp; 
              to have a championship/be part of a championship season.&nbsp; BUT, only 
              1 National Football League team out of 32 teams can be the overall champion, 
              although, if you count conference and division champions, you open the 
              competitive door to 12 teams competing for 9 championships, which will 
              be held by 6 of the teams (with one team holding two:&nbsp; division, 
              conference, and one holding three:&nbsp; division, conference, league).&nbsp; 
              Therefore, the &#147;product&#148; can never be the Superbowl.&nbsp; The 
              only product that counts is the game and the way it&#146;s played.&nbsp; 
              Individuals and teams can have off days.&nbsp; But they should be far 
              and few between.&nbsp; In the language of &#147;the old West,&#148; there 
              is always a faster gun&#148;.&nbsp; In sports, if the other team is faster 
              on the draw, so be it.&nbsp; You live to come back and stand at high noon 
              again.&nbsp; The product has to be a great game played at the highest 
              level by all team members, which is also the only legitimate criteria 
              for evaluating coaches, not W-L.&nbsp; As John Wooden says, when the game 
              is over the key is not whether you won or lost but whether you can say 
              you played the very best that you can.&nbsp; That equals a good game.&nbsp; 
              And they are obtained by players playing for great coaches.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11).. League goals:&nbsp; produce 
              top product, sustain growth domestically and around the world, all the 
              while doing so profitably.&nbsp; The salary cap of payrolls is really 
              only the #2 issue in the National Football League.&nbsp; It is raised 
              to status of #2 because of the free agency (which used to be about fairness 
              to individuals, long since resolved).&nbsp; But salary cap and free agency 
              pale before the key, #1 issue:&nbsp; protecting the GOOSE that lays the 
              golden eggs for (1) players, (2) coaches, (3) owners, (4) investors, (5) 
              cities, (6) states, (7) businesses, (8) TV, (9) products and services 
              of all kinds (via endorsements of players and through advertising during 
              games), and (10) employees being paid directly and indirectly because 
              of working for someone under #&#146;s 1-9.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12).. New TV Public Relations goals:&nbsp; 
              (1) Hold a League TV team special, or some other kind of broadcast ceremony, 
              honoring all 12 teams prior to the playoffs.&nbsp; The movies do it (Oscars), 
              music does it (country music and MTV awards), TV does it (Emmys), etc., 
              etc., etc.&nbsp; Regardless, 12 cities would get to celebrate.&nbsp; It 
              opens a positive way to spotlight the warrior culture of the National 
              Football League over the WWF.&nbsp; It widens the support for the overall 
              goose that lays the golden eggs, letting in fans from the 16 teams which 
              will not make the playoffs in a 32 team league to pick new team(s) to 
              root for in the playoffs, and thus stay engaged.&nbsp; This helps feed 
              the goose.&nbsp; (2) Hold a League TV individual special, or some other 
              kind of broadcast ceremony, honoring top record setters.&nbsp; (3) Hold 
              a League TV coach special, or some other kind of broadcast ceremony, honoring 
              top head coaches and assistants.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wealth Building Goals:&nbsp; horizontal and 
              vertical for the League, teams, individuals<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The key to corporate and 
              individual financial success is multiple sources of income and the ability 
              to influence the decisions about those sources, vertically (as individuals; 
              a ranked return formula can be worked out based on productivity, meaning 
              differentials for star players vis a vis the others, rather than huge, 
              up front salary packages), and horizontally (as they engage in other projects 
              outside the organization).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The key wealth generator 
              for owners, coaches, and players, is the combo of (1) organizational changes, 
              (2) building a new stadium, (3) the 40 in 26, and (4) new opportunities 
              coming over the event horizon. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional 
              sources for wealth building that apply to any team, both horizontally 
              and vertically, are the revenue generating ways in Section II of this 
              model, all of which can, in some way, also apply to individuals, and can 
              add to both team and individual benefits.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Vertical example:&nbsp; 
              pieces like (1) the investment pool and (2) other projects (for instance, 
              we have one which could be used by player/coach wives to make money which 
              would add to their income), which can provide additional downstream income 
              to players to help offset salary cap limitations that threaten to destroy 
              every team in terms of putting key players and obvious hall of famers 
              into musical chair rotations around the league, enriching themselves while 
              devastating teams and roster plans and slowly but ever so surely killing 
              the goose that lays the golden eggs as fans either drift away or lose 
              team loyalty and follow the player(s) instead (we live in a soap opera 
              culture with fans attached to their heroes, both the continuing dramas 
              of their athletic teams and their afternoon and evening continuing dramas 
              (hence Vince McMahon wrestling programs are more soap opera interactions 
              than they are actually wrestling; couch potatoes, by definition, live 
              vicariously through the drama of others).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Fake &#147;free&#148; 
              money seems to be the point of view by sportscasters and fans and most 
              media types, as they eagerly urge and applaud players to skip town under 
              the money umbrella of free agency, expressing, perhaps, their own yearnings 
              (of sports writers, other media and broadcast types, and even fans) to 
              escape town.&nbsp; They appear to be fascinated to the point of being 
              hypnotized by players leaving in free agency for big bucks, complaining 
              of the high cost of tickets as they applaud the actions that cause it.&nbsp; 
              Its as if they are playing monopoly &#150; the money is free and fake, 
              so help yourself.&nbsp; In a word, they feel with other people&#146;s 
              money.&nbsp; It&#146;s like watching &#147;Who wants to be a millionaire&#148;, 
              as if breaking away for ludicrous sums of money is the determiner of value 
              and worth.&nbsp; Ironically, as these sportscasters, fans, and media types 
              root for players to get all they can, they are also sowing the seeds of 
              their own team&#146;s destruction.&nbsp; That&#146;s a train wreck in 
              the making.&nbsp; Good coaches will be fired for losing and lousy coaches 
              will finesse staying by blaming it on free agency, and players will be 
              in a dollar denominated caste system that could eventually lead to the 
              demise of the game, either because people become disdainful of the monies 
              made (although no one minds retirement funds) or because those same monies 
              require such increases in costs of stadium seats and cable TV viewing 
              or pay-for-view, that fans will leave for other sports.&nbsp; This is 
              a goose killer.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp;&nbsp; Horizontal 
              example:&nbsp; a company like Arrakis, a wholly owned start-up of J.P. 
              Morgan &amp; Co., has been dubbed &#147;Building the Anti-J.P. Morgan&#148; 
              by Business Week (9-18-00, p. 134).&nbsp; Its goal:&nbsp; to acquire &#147;a 
              quarter of North America&#146;s estimated 7 million millionaires to sign 
              up with Morgan Online for $2,500/year,&#148; providing a service which 
              can &#147;offer new features to clients every 90 days.&#148;&nbsp; They 
              are working on a full breadth software:&nbsp; &#147;The software can spit 
              out a lifetime&#146;s income and spending estimates, crunching everything 
              from executive stock options to municipal bonds, college tuition, and 
              taxes.&#148;&nbsp; 100 developers are working on the software.&nbsp; They 
              are moving quickly as competition is coming:&nbsp; &#147;Goldman, Sachs 
              &amp; Co. is expected to come out with a competitive offering in the U.S. 
              this fall.&nbsp; By then, J.P. Morgan hopes to be signing up the new rich 
              in Europe and Japan.&nbsp; Teams could partner with local or NYC or Chicago 
              investment firms to manage parts of player salaries that go directly into 
              the pool for management, with the earnings to be paid out either when 
              they leave the team or rolled over into a retirement fund with payouts 
              beginning at specific ages reached by the player.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; These would be great tools 
              for the League in general and, if the league is hesitant, something any 
              team could experiment with by making it a factor in its structure to save 
              upfront dollars and pay from invested downstream dollars, which is a win-win 
              for both the team and players, generating wealth for both owner and players.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8)&nbsp;&nbsp; And here 
              is a great hook:&nbsp; for any investment vehicles in which the contributions 
              are made solely by the team:&nbsp; they help foster longevity (golden 
              handcuffs) with the player, as they have to be vested to collect.&nbsp; 
              Vestment would be based on either a set number of years or when the player 
              either retired or whose career was cut short due to injury.&nbsp; Thus, 
              the player would have to be vested to gain all of the funds, meaning that 
              if he took a free agency trade elsewhere within a specified time frame, 
              the penalty would be assessed, just as is done with other retirement funds:&nbsp; 
              anywhere from giving up 25% to 100% of what has already been put aside 
              for the player as well as that which is projected income after vestment.&nbsp; 
              To keep it fair, any player cut from the team would automatically be vested 
              (per the rules at the time).&nbsp; The only penalty assessed, forfeiture, 
              would be only on those, as corporations do, for a player who leaves voluntarily 
              to join another team or who break specific contract stipulations (drug 
              use, felony convictions, morals clause violations, etc.)&nbsp; The forfeited 
              funds stay in the pool.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making it happen<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              To make this work, the league will have to engage the union about this 
              salary cap and free agency situation, to have them join first as either 
              junior partners or &#147;senior partners&#148; as is done in law firms, 
              consulting firms, investment funds, etc.&nbsp; The college ranks offer 
              an example, where they have instituted steps to foster parity as well, 
              resulting in generating more revenues.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              All of these suggestions are designed to enable the League to engage in 
              wealth building for all without wealth busting.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              How to keep from killing the goose that lays the golden eggs?&nbsp; Allow 
              wiggle room (a &#147;tax&#148; on over spenders), and then raise the low 
              end of salaries and lower the high end to get more players to buy in, 
              while at the same time establishing the investment pools that will pay 
              off according to a point system based on number of years played and contributions 
              in terms of comparing them to others in their position (star performance 
              levels vs. non-star), and then add a vested principle, to foster both 
              longer staying with teams and still providing more money, relatively speaking, 
              for top players.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              In business, stock options that can be cashed later are called golden 
              handcuffs, making executives think twice before leaving.&nbsp; Why not 
              in the National Football League?&nbsp; Indeed, teams could create stock 
              plans tied to revenue (not profits which can be &#147;accounted&#148; 
              to zero, no matter how much is taken in) and install a similar &#147;option&#148; 
              plan, using not ownership stock, but a tracking stock or similar non-owning, 
              non-voting investment vehicle.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              At the same time, purposefully shave operations costs and reduce ticket 
              costs, generating more excitement and fan participation to increase profits 
              all around in order to allow players a higher amount in their profit share 
              at the end of the season.&nbsp; In this way, well coached teams with players 
              who will show up to play each game will win.&nbsp; Well run organizations 
              will have profits to share.&nbsp; And even if they don&#146;t win, if 
              they play their best, with no &#147;dogging&#148;, interest will remain 
              and the fans will still watch and stay engaged.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              In other words, give players an additional freedom, not less:&nbsp; not 
              just the freedom to leave for higher salaries, but the freedom to stay 
              where they want to (when they want to), and earn &#147;lost&#148; free 
              agent dollars back from the profit pool and vested retirement plan with 
              a team and city they don&#146;t want to leave.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              After being with one team for a while and living in their city, there 
              are those who don&#146;t want to move, while there are others who, for 
              non-monetary reasons, want to move regardless of money.&nbsp; This plan 
              would satisfy both.</p>
