  <h3 align="center">Twelve Stadium Financing/Operating Models</h3>
  <p align="center">[The 12 Are Followed By a Sample Projection of Revenue 
    Yields]</p>
  <p><b>The ideal would be to use no new taxes.</b> This is totally possible 
    with the models listed here. Given the nature of the development, certainly 
    public funds will be needed for local infrastructure like roads and sewers, 
    etc., as for any development. In other words, <b>some investment is needed 
      in order preserve the taxes that would not be available if the teams were 
      not here. </b></p>
  <p>There are many subsidies, federal and state and local. Many are not visible. 
    These others are not visible as they make their millions and contribute 
    to the tax revenues, whereas the teams and players are very visible, for 
    the latter is what splashes on the news and across the headlines, not 
    the other entities. It is unfair to subsidize so many others and then 
    single out the teams for nothing, especially when they can build stadiums 
    within the current tax law and by adding a very small tax on sources <b>other 
      than </b>income and property taxes of the average tax payer.</p>
  <p>And when one looks at how the tax payers of Bloomington are investing 
    $63-$100 million in the new Mall of America expansion (which the NHL NorthStars 
    wanted to do when this was their property but were denied), as one example, 
    the $100-150 million needed for a new stadium, especially if it is financed 
    and not funded by the state, doesn&#146;t seem to be very much. <b>And 
      when you &quot;mix and match&quot; parts of each model, including suggestions 
      received from others, you can still end up with a result of no new taxes, 
      regardless of model. </b></p>
  <p><b>A key consideration is revenue stream assignments.</b> Teams need 
    the stadium revenue streams to be competitive. Therefore, having all of 
    the stadium revenue streams pay off financing bonds is not acceptable 
    to the teams (understandably, from their standpoint), although it should 
    still be placed on the table as a point in the negotiations. HOWEVER, 
    if the state were to work with the teams to generate the kind of mixed 
    used commercial development noted in Models #2 and 4, there would be non-stadium 
    revenue that could be used. And to be clear, for there to be true negotiations, 
    everything has to be on the table, with the resolution starting from there. 
    And if the 40 revenue means in 26 categories are used, there will be plenty 
    for both stadium construction and on-going maintenance as well as team 
    operations.</p>
  <p><b>The ten models, with comment and 3rd party verification, are as follows: </b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1. The private investment model</b> of <b>New Ballpark, Inc.</b> (led by the heads of Wells Fargo and US Bank) and C-17 for the Twins.</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> championed and verified by the heads 
      of Wells Fargo and US Bank. </p>
    <p><b>2.</b> An earlier <b>commercial real estate multi-use stadium complex</b> proposal made to the Twins&#146; Ben Hurst, which would not require 
      any new taxes. </p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> worked out in commercial real estate 
      deals across the state and country, of which mixed use shopping centers/office 
      space and housing (condos, apartments, free standing homes) are the 
      most obvious and the Mall of America is the most famous. </p>
    <p><b>3.</b> An earlier<b> commercial real estate multi-use stadium complex</b> proposal, which would not require any new taxes, made by Norm Green, 
      regarding the NorthStars NHL team at their Met Arena, but Minneapolis 
      denied him. </p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification</b>: He took it to Texas. The Met Arena area 
      is now Mall of America Phase II.</p>
    <p><b>4.</b> The<b> private-public Vikings model</b> combines NFL and 
      Vikings moneys ($150 million), stadium related taxing using existing 
      laws ($200 million), leaving a gap of $150 million, which could be completely 
      closed by a half cent hotel/motel tax levy.</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> already worked out by the Vikings, with 
      only the small half-cent hotel/motel tax to be put in place to make 
      the final financing a reality. When proposed in 2001, the legislature 
      was opposed. </p>
    <p><b>5. PJJ&#146;s multi-use facility/site model,</b> with its claim 
      of not needing any new taxes. </p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> this model has been shown to (1) a guy 
      in the stadium building business who says every team should follow it, 
      (2) to a venture capital guy who says it will work, theoretically, and 
      (3) to a former Big 8 guy (he went on his own before they became Big 
      5), who also says it is sound on the dollar side, with the only major 
      difficulty he finds being the one he says exists for all large projects: 
      getting the disparate groups needed to make it happen to work together. 
      This, of course, is the call for &quot;a public discussion&quot; in 
      which a &quot;family meeting&quot; can provide the setting to resolve 
      this comes into play, and where the conflict resolution models of Appendix 
      L of this model comes into play. These macro and micro models/mechanisms 
      will enable that discussion and resolution to take place. </p>
    <p>Finally, the former Big 8 guys estimates <b>$5 million</b> to put the 
      whole package together (physical model, plans, blue prints, agreements 
      with the various jurisdictions, etc., etc., etc.) and <b>$50 million </b>from the owner to oversee putting together the bricks and mortar. 
      Interestingly enough, that is the exact amount figured for the owner&#146;s 
      revenue contribution line of the financing outline.</p>
    <p><b>6. The university funding models</b> of Appendix A of Model #5.</p>
    <p>3rd party verification: universities: the information and individually 
      identified universities who have already done so, as listed in Appendix 
      A of Model 5, can provide the specifics once they are contacted. But 
      they have obtained the funding, ranging from total state funding to 
      totally private funding, to combinations in between. In other words, 
      private citizens can make it happen for university stadiums over which 
      these citizens will have no control, surely private citizens can make 
      it happen for professional stadiums they will control.</p>
    <p><b>7. The 40 ways to generate revenue in 26 revenue categories,</b> which are part of Model #5 above, but which could be used by any of 
      them.</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification: </b>40 ways in 26 categories to generate 
      revenues, which is introduced in Model #4: fits any model. </p>
    <p><b>8. The private funding model</b> proposed to the Vikings by Lyle 
      Berman. </p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification: </b>Berman provided the pro formas. </p>
    <p><b>9. The private funding model to finance a new stadium</b> being 
      used by Steve Young and Brent Jones, with backing from Silicon Valley, 
      as they search for a team to buy.</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> contact Steve Young and/or Brent Jones.</p>
    <p><b>10. The public-private model</b> of the new Houston Texans</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> Houston and the new owner combined to 
      lay $1 billion on the dollar to build a new stadium, operate the new 
      team, and compensate the other owners for letting in an expansion team.</p>
    <p><b>11. The combination of a casino with a stadium,</b> either (a) on 
      a reservation near the Twin Cities or (b) a state owned one from which 
      the profits go to pay for the stadium, etc.</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification:</b> the Casino folks, state and tribe, can 
      provide the information for this one. It is also part of a proposal 
      made in 2002.</p>
    <p><b>12. A hybrid mix and match</b> creatively developed from parts of 
      the above.</p>
    <p><b>3rd party verification</b>: see above, Models 1-11.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>For the purposes of this report: no pro formas</b> accompanied any 
    of these models <b>as they are presented here.</b> They exist with the 
    originators of each, who can be asked to provide them for the legislature 
    (except #5, although similar ones can be obtained by Models #1-4, 8-9). 
    Also, as leagues will work with legislators and teams in working out pro 
    formas, they too need to be contacted. As the NFL would be putting up 
    a sizeable amount, they have and would provide pro formas as they have 
    them, which the new team can use. </p>
  <p><b>The key to pro formas,</b> however, is to pay attention to their assumptions 
    and how they are verified, for that tells how traditional or leading edge 
    they are, what &quot;what-if&quot; analyses they provide, what all is 
    covered in their projected vs. real example cash flows, including both 
    sunk costs and opportunity costs, as well as fixed and variable costs, 
    depreciation, taxes, and profits that can be kept or diverted when combining 
    a stadium with a multi-use commercial development, etc., and so forth 
    and so on, by accounting category. Obviously, it is more than important, 
    it is mandatory to use industry standards in developing such pro formas. <b>HOWEVER</b>, note that as most such stadiums are not of the mixed-use 
    variety, it will require using pro formas from the mixed-use commercial 
    development industry as well as the professional sports industry. Note 
    also that the pro forma mix needs also to be added to for Model #5, as 
    it goes beyond both commercial development and professional sports to 
    creating its own unique &quot;sports-entertainment-commercial development&quot; 
    model. </p>
  <p><b>From a business standpoint,</b> teams need to be able to generate 
    revenues to survive, as any business. There is <b>resentment</b> in those 
    ideologically moved to resent, but it is unwarranted. TV stars of successful 
    shows that draw lots of viewers make far more money than athletes. When 
    David Sarnoff, founder of RCA and NBC was asked why he paid millions to 
    Johnny Carson, he said it was because people won&#146;t tune in to watch 
    Sarnoff. They tuned in to watch Johnny. He was responsible for bringing 
    in and keeping the fans and their advertising revenue and network brand 
    name loyalty. Carson&#146;s &quot;Tonight&quot; show was NBC&#146;s most 
    successful show ever, accounting for 17% of the network&#146;s profit. 
    In other words, he earned that money. The same is true of the teams who 
    have sellouts and high TV ratings. They are not overpaid in terms of what 
    they cause to be generated for the business as a whole, and all of the 
    other businesses that benefit from the teams being there, including <b>all </b> of the major media outlets (newspapers, radio stations, Television 
    stations), not to mention the tax collector. </p>
  <p>And with the coming demographics of population growth (which will make 
    the baby boomers seem like a small blip on the screen), there will also 
    be plenty of growth, including both those born and moving where the team 
    will play to assure a continuous increase in revenues. The Sporting News 
    online article on Pete Rozelle, on December 20, 1999, says this about 
    the NFL: &quot;by far the most influential and most watched sport in all 
    of the United States&#133;.[a] ratings-gobbling, argument-provoking, dollar-generating, 
    thoroughly entertaining and amazingly dominant conglomerate&#133;.&quot;</p>
  <p><b>OTHER FINANCING MECHANISMS TO ADD TO ANY OF THE ABOVE </b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>A Word About Lease Bonds<br>
    Backed by State Income Tax On Players (local AND out of state players)</b></p>
  <p>The key here is not the lease bonds but<b> the taxes on players, both 
    local and on other teams when they play the local team.</b> This fits 
    the financing not funding approach. It makes sense to use these taxes 
    to back lease bonds with the state income tax collected on local and other 
    teams&#146; players&#146; salaries&quot;. </p>
  <p><b>Two examples: Oregon</b> has agreed to use these taxes <b>to back 
    $150 million in bonds agreed </b>if it is able to obtain a MLB team for 
    Portland. <b>California</b> alone <b>will collect $94 million in 2001,</b> just from out of state athletes. This should make it even easier as it 
    provides a common ground for those who are understandably queasy about 
    either a total private funding or a total public funding. <b>It creates 
      an even better private-public partnership, to enable keeping the teams 
      in a fashion that is economically beneficial to all. </b>It makes an even 
    better private-public partnership than it was before. And who will argue 
    with taxing out-of-state players? No one. They will cheer. Local players 
    pay there. Why not their players paying here? </p>
  <p><b>And who can argue against applying these taxes to back revenue bonds</b> if, without them, the teams are lost either to contraction or relocation 
    and all of that revenue is lost anyway? Neither the fans that love their 
    teams nor the businesses that benefit from their being there, nor the 
    tax collectors anticipating that revenue, nor the angry voters that would 
    result if they were &quot;lost&quot;, nor the angry populace as a whole&#146;s 
    pride factor. This would also preclude the need of the state to dictate 
    things like where the money goes, such as the proposal for the naming 
    rights money to go to the state which the teams understandably resist, 
    nor to dictate ticket prices, etc. (although true negotiations put everything 
    on the table and work from there to get to what is acceptable to those 
    parties involved in the negotiations). With the approaches outlined here, 
    its pure win-win all the way around. </p>
  <p align="center"><b>A Word About Owner Principal </b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>To Generate Interest Revenue to Pay At Least Half the 
    Payments for the Bonds</b></p>
  <p>Click on box to make large enough to read</p>
  <p>The chart shows how the investors (bond payers) buy $330 million in taxable 
    revenue bonds from the state, earning 6.5%. The State channels the $330 
    million to the host city which builds the stadium. The team (with or without 
    help from the league and other private investors) provides a &quot;gift&quot; 
    of $165 million to the state. The bonds are paid off from the interest 
    earned on the principle of the $165 million and plus the $165 million. </p>
  <p>The interest paid would be $11.5 million yearly for 30 years earned on 
    the $165 million gift. An additional $10 million would be paid by the 
    team and host city for 30 years. With voter approval, the host ciy can 
    impose new local taxes to pay its share.<br>
    Sample Projection of Upfront Revenue Yields</p>
  <p>Which may or may not involve the lease bonds and revenue bonds of above.</p>
  <p>Thus, there are 11 revenue sources to pay off any stadium. These are 
    listed on the next page.</p>
  <p>If the 12 salary categories are used for compensation, the original pool 
    for the 12 part salary set up would come from the up front as well as 
    yearly revenue yields. </p>
  <p>The 12 salary categories are (1) signing bonus, (2) salary cap, (3) golden 
    handcuffs (stay for minimum amount of years to vest in team retirement 
    plan), (4) golden parachutes (1-2 year &quot;severance pay&quot; if receive 
    play ending injury, any time, or are &quot;cut&quot; after four years, 
    (5) participation in profit pool (with each player being a &quot;partner&quot;), 
    (6) player stock option pool, with the players getting options which will 
    be worth significantly more later on; (7) ESOPs (employee stock ownership 
    plan of Louis Kelso), (8) retirement plans, (9) personal affairs assistance 
    and/or management, (11) tangible and intangible &quot;perks&quot; related 
    to special events for players and/or families (spouse and/or kids), internal 
    recruitment (continuous &quot;recruitment&quot; of players team wants 
    to keep), and (12) newsletter reporting regarding investments, opportunities, 
    and other issues related to post-playing years.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Sample Projection of Upfront Revenue Yields</b></p>
  <p><b>1. $50 million</b> -- one time, by the owner/ownership group (but 
    might not have to </p>
  <p>depending upon yield of #5 below)</p>
  <p><b>2. $25-50 million</b> -- one time, by the public for infrastructure 
    (i.e., state costs: land and </p>
  <p>site prep, streets and sewers, etc. Amount to be determined by final 
    design. Amount is capped at $50 million. Team covers all costs above $50 
    million.</p>
  <p><b>3. $100-200 million</b> -- bonds backed by ticket and parking revenues 
    over time. </p>
  <p><b>4. $450-850 million</b> -- up front, by investors (the DreamWorks 
    model raised $2 billion). Could also be tailored to include public investment 
    participation to share the wealth with others (fans, community), in order 
    to take the sting off the notion that teams are wealthy and therefore 
    unfair recipients of the money earned. Note also: There are numerous investment 
    funds set up that are trolling in the Far East with big funds to buy up 
    companies that tanked during their downturn; their turn-a-rounds, generate 
    enormous returns on their investments, requiring them to find investments 
    like well conceived stadium complexes to soften their tax burden.</p>
  <p><b>5. $150 million</b> -- amount of bonds to be backed by a half or one 
    cent tax on tourists (hotel/motel tax). Amount depends on the jurisdiction 
    and the negotiated profit sharing amount. This amount might not be part 
    of the mix as sentiments shift from tax maximizing to tax cutting.</p>
  <p><b>$725 million to 1.250 billion up front</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Sample Projection of Yearly Revenue Yields</b></p>
  <p>1. $75-100 million -- yearly from taxes on players, local and on other 
    teams playinglocally. California alone will collect $94 million in 2001. 
    Oregon has agreed to use these player taxes to back $150 million in bonds 
    agreed if it is able to obtain a MLB team for Portland. This allows the 
    state to use these to make payments on the money borrowed.</p>
  <p>2. $25-50 million -- yearly from &quot;anchors&quot; &amp; others in 
    non-stadium part of complex.</p>
  <p>Amount to be determined by extent of development and final negotiations 
    with anchors. <b>NOTE</b> they will finance the construction of their 
    part of the complex</p>
  <p>3. $25-50 million -- yearly from casinos and/or other state gambling 
    revenue</p>
  <p>4. $100-200 million from the team Web portal&#146;s Internet IPO to generate 
    revenues for </p>
  <p>construction and/or on-going operations (the airlines have made more 
    profit from their Internet reservation IPOs than they have from running 
    their airlines). </p>
