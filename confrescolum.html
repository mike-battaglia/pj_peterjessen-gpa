  <p align="center">In 1998, the set consisted of 5 macro models.<br>
    In 2000, an additional set of 5 was added, of micro models.<br>
    In August of 2001, the documents included 7 each micro and macro for 14 
    models.<br>
    Just before 9/11/01 one more macro/micro model was added, and again a 
    set after 9/11.<br>
    <strong>These models have been rendered all the more relevant in light 
    of 9/11/01.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; </p align="center">
  <p align="left" class="style1">The original 5 models were developed for 
    the June 2000 &quot;Columbine P.S.&quot; paper on education, on this web 
    site.&nbsp; &nbsp;These models are for use in conflict resolution, to 
    enable the establishing of dialogue between all stakeholders by enabling 
    them to conduct their own dialogue marathon:&nbsp; 8 at the macro-societal 
    and institutional level, and 8 at the micro-individual level for use in 
    face-to-face encounters, whether the other individual(s) does or does 
    no represent a larger institution of society.&nbsp; These models can be 
    used to avoid what is often a disastrous swing of the pendulum, in order 
    to enable all involved to use what is described below as a &#147;calculus 
    of meaning&#148; and a &#147;calculus of pain&#148; to assist in their 
    deliberations.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">As before, the models are for use in conflict 
    resolution, to enable the establishing of dialogue between all stakeholders 
    by enabling them to conduct their own dialogue marathon:&nbsp; 9 at the 
    macro-societal and institutional level, and 9 at the micro-individual 
    level for use in face-to-face encounters, whether the other individual(s) 
    does or does no represent a larger institution of society.&nbsp; These 
    models can be used to avoid what is often a disastrous swing of the pendulum, 
    in order to enable all involved to use what is described below as a calculus 
    of meaning and a calculus of pain to assist in their deliberations.&nbsp;

  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Regarding the 18 models of 
    conflict resolution</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="style1"><br>
    These 18 show how we can both understand conflicts and develop workable 
    resolutions for solving them, whether personal (micro) or between larger 
    aggregations of individuals in the institutions and nations of society 
    and the world (macro).&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="style1"><br>
    Peter Berger has coined, among many highly useful terms, this pair: &quot;<em>historically 
      specific conservatives</em>&quot; (those of the left or right who would 
    usher in their desired type of society and then freeze it in place) and <em>historically nonspecific conservatives</em>&quot; (those who accept 
    change and make haste slowly).&nbsp; I find them so much more useful as 
    a way of looking at the ideological landscape (as it cannot be avoided).&nbsp; 
    As I also state on those pages, this and another pair of Berger's analytical 
    word tools,&quot;calculus of meaning&quot; and &quot;calculus of pain&quot;, 
    are, in my judgment, the critical one- two punch of analysis and conflict 
    resolution.&nbsp; They are two of the four key organizing principles for 
    dealing with such conflict resolution, along with the concepts of &quot;lists/recipes&quot; 
    and collaboration.&nbsp; &quot;Recipes&quot; comes from Berger as well, 
    through Alfred Schutz.&nbsp; All of which I would make a part of what 
    Cassidy call the politics of love, &quot;which has to be both the umbrella 
    over and foundation under all discussions and interactions if true conflict 
    resolution is to be achieved in a way that love and justice pervades and 
    is received and perceived by both sides.&quot;&nbsp; These models are 
    of particular importance and relevance in the continuing conflicts in 
    the world today, whether by nation-states or independent groups dedicated 
    to changing society through violence.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="style1"><br>
    <span class="style4"><strong>THE 9 MACRO<a name="MACRO"></a> MODELS</strong></span></p>
  <ol class="style1">
    <li> Masada<a name="Masada"></a>, a &quot;how NOT to work things out. 
      It is a story set in Palestine/Israel of 72 A.D.&nbsp; It is a story 
      of the failure to attempt or trust mediation (although it is not known 
      if any was attempted).&nbsp; The Zealots, on top of the 1300 foot plateau, 
      were unable to prevent the Romans' slow, methodical, progress of building 
      a ramp to the top of the sheer cliff in order to breach their defenses 
      (FN#13).&nbsp; It is a lesson in both international and local politics 
      and an opportunity to understand our own behavior better.&nbsp; &quot;Masada&quot; 
      was a four part ABC Novel for Television, April 5-8, 1981.&nbsp; Having 
      people watch the video tape would be an excellent dynamic.&nbsp; CIS 
      (Cultural Information Service), in NYC, wrote a marvelous study guide 
      for it, that stands alone as a guide to any discussion regarding conflict 
      resolution, peace, etc., as well.&nbsp; It is 15 pages, with pictures, 
      on 11x14 paper (FN#14)<br>
    </li>
    <li> &quot;The Evangelical Academies<a name="Academies"></a>&quot; model 
      of post World War II West Germany, where the mediator is the faith community, 
      discussed in the book Confession, Conflict &amp; Community.&nbsp; They 
      were established by the faith community.&nbsp; In a word, unlike Humpty 
      Dumpty and all the king's men, they&nbsp; were able to help put West 
      Germany back together again, as &quot;the academies played a singular 
      role in restoring the democratic idea after the disaster of the Third 
      Reich.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;The Evangelical Academies&quot; have been in 
      continuous use, and were central to the recreation of West Germany.&nbsp; 
      These &quot;academies&quot; provided a sense of dialogue between all 
      the parties, fostering and enabling a kind of &quot;mediating action&quot; 
      to take place between the social and political forces (not as in arbitration 
      or in seeking compromise, but rather in the sense of creating a &quot;zone 
      of freedom&quot; in which the concerns of all sides could be brought 
      to bear upon the urgent issues before them, using a set general process 
      agendas in which the specifics could be discussed and dealt with by 
      all concerned.&nbsp; The meetings were held outside the cities in the 
      country side, with minimal distractions, and always with a mixed group 
      of stakeholders.&nbsp; The first conference brought together &quot;150 
      lawyers and economists&quot; and later ones &quot;laborers, farmers, 
      physicians, and social service workers--people from all walks of life.&quot;&nbsp; 
      A key lesson learned was the importance and &quot;necessity for each 
      occupational group within the framework of modern society to encounter 
      the group that it most complained about.&quot;&nbsp; (FN#6)<br>
      <br>
      The academies continued through the decades, with problems addressed 
      ranging from road locations to international issues of concern.&nbsp; 
      19 Academies continue today under an umbrella association, and is working 
      with similar movements in Africa, Asia and America.&nbsp; They were 
      also used in East Germany to give citizens a place to gather and discuss 
      prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall (prior to which over 1,500 conferences 
      were held each year), and then used later to help in the reunification 
      of West Germany and East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
      (FN#7)&nbsp; Why not regarding education in America?<br>
    </li>
    <li>The mediation<a name="mediation"></a> model used in South Africa.&nbsp; 
      The model is outlined as a theoretical piece as well as being discussed 
      in the practical terms of its actual use in this setting.&nbsp; The 
      1989 book The Passing Summer : A South African's Response to White Fear, 
      Black Anger, and the Politics of Love, by Michael Cassidy, discusses 
      the situational complex of apartheid in the summer of 1986, including 
      the several centuries of actions that led to apartheid.&nbsp; The actual 
      South Africa mediation model is outlined in the 1988 book A Future South 
      Africa:&nbsp; Visions, Strategies, and Realities, edited by Peter L. 
      Berger and Bobby Godsell. On page 320-321 of the Berger-Godsell book 
      is the &quot;Analytic Scheme&quot; for guiding the research and, on 
      pp. 322-323, is Peter Berger's outline for &quot;reality-testing&quot; 
      what is being done.&nbsp; The change in South Africa, as anywhere else, 
      did not &quot;just&quot; happen.&nbsp; The Berger-Godsell report was 
      released in 1988, two years before Nelson Mandella was released from 
      prison, who was then elected President in 1994.&nbsp; After 1988 and 
      1989, the contents of these two books merged in the conferences that 
      were held to discuss the transition out of apartheid.<br>
      <br>
      In an update received from Bobby Godsell in March 2000, he discusses 
      four additional conferences which were particularly helpful, conferences 
      which bear witness to how well this model can be used successfully all 
      along the spectrum of stakeholder positions.&nbsp; The four conferences 
      were:&nbsp; (1) 1989, called by the then new Afrikaner Nationalist president, 
      FW de Klerk to address the problems of political violence (which the 
      African National Conference boycotted); (2) 1994:&nbsp; called by a 
      Kenyan Bishop which resulted in involving the Inkatha Movement, led 
      by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, just weeks before the first democratic election 
      in 1994, enabling it to join the now cooperating ANC and de Klerk government; 
      (3-4) the use of the &quot;reality testing&quot; model of the referenced 
      1988 book by groups on the far right and left:&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Broederbond, 
      a secret Afrikaner Nationalist intellectual organization, led during 
      this critical period by J P de Lange, and by the South African Communist 
      Party.&nbsp; Of these latter two, Bobby Godsell states, &quot;In both 
      cases they concluded that [their old] strategies were not possible,&quot; 
      and thus they too joined to work cooperatively with the other stakeholders 
      regarding South Africa's development&quot; (FN#11).&nbsp; And such mediation 
      continues.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Godsell also reports (FN#9) that &quot;Evangelical Christianity continues 
      to play a surprising role in providing a common road to modernity for 
      black and white, left and right&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (FN#10).&nbsp; It 
      is the &quot;common road,&quot; properly given a &quot;realty testing,&quot; 
      which provides its users with a peaceful outcome as well as opportunity 
      to move toward a more just one. Perhaps the title of Michael Cassidy's 
      book shows us why it worked in South Africa and why it can work in education 
      in the United States:&nbsp; The Passing Summer : A South African's Response 
      to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love.&nbsp; Fear and 
      anger clouded both the presentation of issues and judgment about them.&nbsp; 
      Love, in the form of the Golden Rule, was used.&nbsp; Love, however 
      defined, whether in terms of civility of discourse, civility in relational 
      interaction, or both, can enable the Archimedean lever of mediation 
      to enable the resolution of the problems to the satisfaction of all 
      stakeholders.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The Oslo<a name="Oslo"></a> Accords Process being used in the Middle 
      East to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority 
      was begun in the woods of Norway.&nbsp; See The New Yorker article, 
      Annals of Diplomacy section (Dec. 20, 1993, pp. 77-85):&nbsp; &quot;THE 
      PEACEMAKERS&quot;.&nbsp; Subhead:&nbsp; &quot;In Norway, two Israeli 
      academics [the initial mediators] worked for months to broker the secret 
      peace--and succeeded where governments had failed.&quot;&nbsp; The initial 
      success of what is being called &quot;The Oslo Accords&quot; has come 
      about because both sides agreed to leave the most contentious issues 
      until last (West bank, the final settlement of Jerusalem, and full sovereignty 
      passed to the Palestinian Authority, or &quot;PA&quot;, among others 
      of the most thorniest issues), so as to work on the areas on which there 
      either was agreement or clear room for negotiation.&nbsp; The theory:&nbsp; 
      that the process of working together would enable both sides to become 
      familiar with each other, break down the walls between them, and develop 
      a kind of trust that would enable them, after resolving the &quot;are 
      negotiable&quot; issues to finally tackle the major issues separating 
      both sides, issues which were originally labeled &quot;non-negotiable.&quot;&nbsp; 
      Theory problem:&nbsp;&nbsp; unlike with West Germany and South Africa, 
      a common faith bond between the two sides is missing.&nbsp; Rather than 
      gradually reconciling with each other (made possible by the use of love, 
      the basis of any faith community context), the process has been one 
      sided, without reconciliation because of the continued propaganda of 
      hate and fanatic Islamism, which has been the staple of the Palestinian 
      culture since the creation of the Jewish state in 1948, and the demand 
      from certain Israeli elements of a restoration of Israel as in Biblical 
      times.&nbsp;&nbsp; The irony is that the Masada roles are now reversed.&nbsp; 
      The Palestinian Authority is acting the role of Rome wanting the Israeli's 
      to act the role of the 1st century Zealots and kill themselves.&nbsp; 
      In its current state, this model is actually moving toward the Palestinian 
      goal of a Masada-like conclusion.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To put it bluntly, the &quot;Oslo Accords&quot; need the &quot;politics 
      of love&quot; (Model #5 below) if the negotiators are to avoid the Masada 
      affect.&nbsp; The empirical reality is that the presence of the acknowledgement 
      of love in Models 2 and 3 were successful, and that its absence led 
      to the failure of #1 and is leading to the failure of #4.&nbsp; #5 organizes 
      this principle for any macro-level conflict negotiation.<br>
    </li>
    <li> The mediation model based on Michael Cassidy's &quot;The Politics

      South African's Response to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics 
      of Love.&nbsp;<br>
      Cassidy proposed this model for South Africa, with the urging that it 
      be incorporated in the country's constitution.&nbsp; As 78% of South 
      Africans (Black and White) professed to be Christians, the politics 
      of love followed their shared belief that &quot;God is love.&quot;&nbsp; 
      The model served as an inspiration to themselves regarding letting their 
      better natures prevail as continues to serve as in inspiration to other 
      peoples of the planet caught in the same kind of process.&nbsp; The 
      model is also practical, in that &quot;the golden rule is finally what 
      life is all about&quot; and is at the heart of every major world religion 
      and most secular philosophies. &nbsp;But how does a nation or large 
      institution incorporate the golden rule all claim to want to follow 
      but find so difficult to follow?&nbsp; Through love, which turns revenge 
      into treating perpetrators of prejudice with the respect and civility.&nbsp; 
      Cassidy regarding meetings with the head of detentions:&nbsp; &quot;I 
      grasped afresh that South African blacks, and especially black Christians, 
      are in many ways incredible. Their capacity to bear pain, to tolerate 
      indignity, to dredge up new goodwill from who knows where and still 
      be gracious, never ceases to amaze me&quot; (p. 19).<br>
      <br>
      Cassidy discusses his ten point model in detail in his book's Part Six, 
      &quot;The Politics of Love (The outworking of love as a valid political 
      principle,&quot; in three chapters, Chapter 19 (&quot;Winning in the 
      World's Workshop&quot; based on the Swiss Hans-Ruedi Weber referring 
      to South Africa as &quot;the laboratory of the world,&quot; in 1973, 
      for how they did would greatly affect the world's belief in what is 
      possible), Chapter 20 (&quot;Love as a Political Virtue&quot; which 
      is to sing songs Cassidy doesn't mention but which relate, the Dianne 
      Warwick song &quot;What the world needs now, is love, love, love&quot;, 
      or the song made popular world-wide by Michael Jackson and Pepsi Cola 
      about the world needing love or Disney's &quot;It's a Small, Small World 
      After All&quot;), and Chapter 21 (&quot;Love in Structures&quot;, as 
      in the constitution, etc.).<br>

    <p> In her book, The Human Condition, the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt 
      says we keep chaos at bay by keeping promises and that we deal with

      forgiveness and reconciliation are not the provenance of Christians, 
      although Jesus emphasizes it more than anyone, but rather that both 
      are necessary because of the &quot;human condition.&quot;&nbsp; To forgive 
      in order to be reconciled requires loving.&nbsp; Love is what is missing

    <li>The 1975 Helsinki<a name="Helsinki"></a> Accords, In terms of the 
      Helsinki Accords, I would juxtapose them with the Oslo Accords as well 
      as with Masada, both of which failed (interestingly enough, both failures 
      were in the Middle East), as I predicted in the items I'm sending to 
      you, as both Oslo and Masada were unable to either recognize and/deal 
      with hate and mistrust, and neither was able to view with love.&nbsp; 
      According to Natan Sharansky, the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords 
      by the Soviet tyrants was when they &quot;signed their own death warrant&quot;&nbsp; 
      (&quot;Why Weren't the Helsinki Standards Also Used for Oslo?&quot; 
      Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2001, p. A18).&nbsp; This &quot;third basket&quot; 
      meant the Soviets and their puppets were agreeing&nbsp; &quot;to uphold 
      the basic human rights of their own subjects&quot;, although they had 
      no intentions of doing so.&nbsp; But this was the &quot;Achilles' heel 
      of the totalitarian state&quot; as all actions were then scrutinized 
      by world opinion according to this agreement (that, plus going bankrupt 
      trying to keep up the arms race, while also intervening militarily in 
      Vietnam and Afghanistan).&nbsp; The &quot;Kremlin eventually buckled 
      under the strain,&quot; as, &quot;forced to relax their tyranny, they 
      released a spark of freedom that spread like a bush fire and burned 
      down an empire&quot;, a reminder from the East to the West that &quot;freedom 
      has the power to change the world.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharansky 
      says the real lesson lost by the Oslo accord folks was that the Soviet 
      &quot;historic collapse was shaped by the moral authority of dissidents&quot; 
      in Russia and the moral authority of certain political leaders in the 
      U.S. willing to use the phrase &quot;evil empire,&quot; which brought 
      near apoplexy from the left in this country. Sharansky's bottom line:&nbsp; 
      &quot;the Oslo accords failed to establish any connection between human 
      rights and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.&quot;<br>

    <li>The third<a name="third"></a> track diplomacy contributions and structures 
      of the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Mozambique, Central and 
      South America, and South Korea.&nbsp; Berger reminds us that the U.S. 
      population as a whole is as religious as India whereas the political 
      and academic elites are as secular as Sweden.&nbsp; This explains to 
      me why they can't deal with morality, as it would be a foot in the door 
      for religion, and religion must be stamped out at every point (see comment 
      on Voltaire below).&nbsp; And religion, more than any other, teaches 
      morality and love.&nbsp; The recent (1999) book edited by Peter Berger, 
      The De-secularization of the World:&nbsp; Resurgent Religion and World 
      Politics, includes a piece by George Weigel, &quot;Roman Catholicism 
      in the Age of John Paul II.&quot;&nbsp; In it he discusses what John 
      Paul II has done as well as the &quot;third track diplomacy&quot; of 
      the Rome-based San' Egidio Community, which he says has played important 
      roles in 3rd track, &quot;most successfully in Mozambique.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Another major difference is the lack of a concept of sin on the political 
      left, for if there is no sin, how can what one is doing be all that 
      wrong?&nbsp; The moral strength of Gandhi in India was not his but England's 
      self image as a moral nation, sinful though it may be, but one that 
      didn't slaughter people, and thus had to withdraw on those moral grounds 
      (a concept totally missing, of course in the Soviet Union and any past 
      and present Marxist states).&nbsp; Ditto in South Africa:&nbsp; it was 
      the vision of people, Black and White, both Christians, that enabled 
      apartheid to be put back in its box.&nbsp; The key now is to prevent 
      its reverse.&nbsp; And the civil rights movement in this country was 
      also fought on a moral base.&nbsp; Martin Luther King could not have 
      been as effective as he was, nor the supreme court able to rule as it 
      did, if it wasn't for the moral sense that counted, the moral sense 
      of everyday Americans, who were revulsed by such scenes as Bull Connor's 
      dogs and the beating of unarmed, peaceful marchers, not to mention the 
      bombing of little girls and the lynching of innocent men, and who said, 
      &quot;but that is not us,&quot; ushering in the change.&nbsp; What nation 
      can survive without such a moral base as it relates to its citizens 
      and to its fellow nations?<br>
      <br>
      But even in moral nations, we need the &quot;politics of love&quot; 
      (sin, and all that, one must recall, aren't going away).&nbsp; Too many 
      seem to have Voltaire's wish.&nbsp; Weigel writes that Voltaire &quot;died 
      with the wish that the last king be strangled with the guts of the last 
      priest.&quot;&nbsp; For all of his defense to the death of one's right 
      to speak their opinion, &quot;the revolution he helped to inspire defined 
      its goal as little less than the overthrow of the civilization the Church 
      had helped nurture for centuries.&quot;&nbsp; When I was in graduate 
      school, those of my fellow grad students who were Marxists told me I 
      would be one of the first ones shot come the revolution (which they 
      sincerely believed would come).&nbsp; I said yes, but you'll be beside 
      me, as the first to go are the intellectuals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduate school 
      in the classroom with Berger was exciting, but with fellow grads disappointing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The left is so lacking in balanced morals (and the concept of &quot;moral 
      equivalency negates morals, making what is moral what one personally 
      feels to be moral, i.e., anything anyone does).&nbsp; But how can you 
      have a sense of morals that is all encompassing of all people if you 
      don't have a concept of sin and therefore believe any action of one's 
      own cannot, by definition be wrong?&nbsp; If one thinks it OK it is 
      by definition OK, as seen by those who are historically specific conservatives 
      on both the left and right.<br>

    <li> The Ubuntu<a name="Ubuntu"></a> Theology of Reconciliation model 
      of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu's theology is seen in 
      the title of this book: No Future Without Forgiveness. Additional understanding 
      can be gained from the book Reconciliation: The Ubuntu Theology of Desmond 
      Tutu by Michael Battle (1993). Additional books of value include The 
      Passing Summer: A South African's Response to White Fear, Black Anger, 
      and the Politics of Love, by Michael Cassidy, A Future South Africa: 
      Visions, Strategies, and Realities, edited by Peter L. Berger and Bobby 
      Godsell (1988). Tutu says &quot;We have got a thing which we call ubuntu, 
      which means humanity.. For Tutu, Ubuntu really means that &quot;I am 
      because you are. We belong together. Our humanity is bound up with one 
      another. We say in our languages, a person is a person through other 
      persons. A solitary human being is a contradiction in terms. I learn 
      how to become a human being through association with other human beings.&quot; 
      In other words, no matter how appropriate &quot;individualism&quot; 
      is, &quot;No man is an island,&quot; as John Donne wrote. Our independence 
      is actually interdependence with each other.<br>
      <br>
      Tutu chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which was established 
      to heal the raw wounds of South Africa's past, consisted of three committees: 
      Amnesty Committee, Reparation and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Committee 
      and Human Rights Violations (HRV) Committee. Tutu's concern was this: 
      as Apartheid ended, what would keep Whites from withdrawing into armed 
      enclaves and what would keep Blacks from wanting to do to Whites what 
      Whites had done to them? How could they be reconciled? For Archbishop 
      Tutu, one word: &quot;ubuntu: I am because we are... a person is a person 
      through other persons.&quot; In fact, it has been such an excellent 
      model of conflict resolution that some hope it will be introduced in 
      Northern Ireland and the Middle East. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
      chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu heard statements from 20,000 witnesses, 
      some 15 percent in public. Showing reconciliation was possible, the 
      committee proved it by being even-handed: criticizing both the Apartheid 
      regime and the ANC for the excesses of their brutality. You can read 
      more on the official web site of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation 
      Commission. Throughout, the key is reconciliation. It can be done. It 
      must be done. As with the other macro models, it is worked through at 
      the micro level. We look forward to seeing it applied elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      The establishment of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
      was a pioneering international event. Never had any country sought to 
      move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing the atrocities 
      committed in the past and achieving reconciliation with its former oppressors. 
      In 1995, Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize Winner was about to retire 
      as Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town when Nelson Mandela asked him to 
      stay on and become the Chairman of the Commission. Tutu argues that 
      true reconciliation cannot be achieved by denying the past. His emphasis: 
      restorative justice over retributional justice. For Tutu, Ubuntu is 
      the African expression that was at the heart of the TRC's labors: &quot;a 
      person is a person through other people.&quot; Ubuntu sums up Tutu's 
      philosophical framework for addressing apartheid's hard truths and beginning 
      the reconciliation process necessary to move beyond apartheid's legacy. 
      Human rights, he affirms, cannot stand without Ubuntu's deeper foundation; 
      the future cannot be without forgiveness. He writes: &quot;To forgive 
      is indeed the best form of self-interest since anger, resentment, and 
      revenge are corrosive of that 'summum bonum,' the greatest good.&quot;<br>

      Kirkus Reviews &quot;No Future Without Forgiveness&quot; which is the 
      &quot;story of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) 
      and a meditation on evil and forgiveness from Nobel laureate Tutu (The 
      Rainbow People of God: The Making of a Peaceful Revolution, 1994). In 
      1994, South Africa faced a historically unique situation. A long-oppressed 
      majority had peacefully taken power from its minority oppressor. As 
      Tutu explains, the question facing the nation was, What then to do? 
      Should Nuremberg-like trials be held against those who had maintained 
      the ghastly system of apartheid? Or, as many whites wished, should the 
      past be forgotten, let bygones be bygones? The new regime found what 
      Tutu calls &quot;a third way&quot; to deal with the past: the Truth 
      and Reconciliation Commission. Those who had committed politically motivated 
      crimes during the apartheid era would receive amnesty if they made full 
      and truthful public disclosures. In turn, the victims of such acts would 
      be allowed to tell their stories in the hopes that this would restore 
      a measure of their human dignity. Over 18 months some 20,000 victims 
      appeared before the commission, imparting their tales of personal anguish&Ntilde;of 
      torture, rape, imprisonment&Ntilde;but also exposing a system perpetrated 
      and supported by the highest levels of government, military, and police. 
      No longer could anyone deny knowledge of the past, as so many whites 
      had; never again would such an evil be allowed to exist in South Africa. 
      Yet it would be not only supporters of apartheid answering for their 
      deeds.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Those who had committed crimes in the fight against the system, including 
      Winnie Mandela, would answer for their acts as well. Tutu's writing 
      on this process is nothing short of miraculous. He is strong in his 
      defense of the commission that so many doubted as either too harsh or 
      too lenient. He is also anguished by the depths of human depravity the 
      commission hearings revealed, but passionately hopeful that human caring 
      and unity might prevail, in South Africa and the world. It is [&quot;a] 
      sober depiction and searing indictment of evil and [a] never-maudlin 
      advocacy of love.&quot;</li>

  <p class="style1">Those interested in education in any town or city, are 
    urged to think beyond the conflict resolution process at the institutional 
    level (the 5 macro models above) and think also of the conflict resolution 
    process within their own minds between their &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; 
    selves as well as between themselves and those they must resolve conflicts 
    with face to face, at home, at work, or at school (the 5 micro models 
    below).&nbsp; A recommended starting place is to consider either the adoption 
    of one of the following models or the development of another model taking 
    elements from any of the other models, whether approached in terms of 
    outcomes or in terms of personal procedures to follow.&nbsp; These micro, 
    face-to-face relationship models can enable people to approach different 
    tasks using the terminology of the field of conflict resolution, enabling

        version of the &quot;horizontal&quot; version of running a marathon).&nbsp; 
        Three types attempt the climb:&nbsp; quitters, who either don't start 
        or who quit soon after starting; campers, who climb for a while and 
        then pitch their tents hoping for conditions to change that they prefer, 
        and just keep waiting, and climbers, who continue, no matter what, 
        to the top.&nbsp; Stoltz's goal for us:&nbsp; to each develop and 
        nurture as high an AQ behavior as possible, to grow a high AQ culture 
        in every organization or group in which one participates, and to thereby 
        each is emailed tpunleash each of our full potential.&nbsp; The key 
        question (p. 281):&nbsp; &quot;How important is it for you to strengthen 
        your AQ and your ability to climb through adversity?&quot;&nbsp; Like 
        Stoltz, we all want to achieve Seligman's &quot;Learned optimism&quot; 
        as a way to change beliefs such that one can see that it does matter 
        what they try, and that they also matter.&nbsp; Stoltz has three key 
        terms:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;CO2RE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        LEADing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Vision<br>
        <br>
        Learn CO2RE (p. 115) and LEADing (p. 154) to create a climbing culture, 
        and develop the Vision (pp. 284-5) needed to sustain it.&nbsp; Teaching 
        AQ to others gives them a great gift:&nbsp; the ability to confront 
        challenge after challenge <br>
        <br>
        C = Control:&nbsp; focus on what you can control, not what you cannot 
        control<br>
        O2 = Origin and Ownership (how did it start; what is your part of 
        the solution)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        R = Reach (goal:&nbsp; don't allow catastrophising to spill over into 
        other areas)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        E = Endurance (to reduce how long the adversity will last)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        L = Listen to your adversity response:&nbsp; high or low?<br>
        E = Explore all origins and your own ownership of the result<br>
        A = Analyze the evidence (regarding whether you have no control, regarding 
        if it really must <br>
        reach other areas, and regarding whether it really has to last a long 
        time)<br>
        D = Do something!&nbsp; (act).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        p. 155:&nbsp; &quot;The LEAD sequence is based on the notion that 
        anyone can alter their success by changing their habits of thought.&nbsp; 
        Change is created by disputing old patterns and consciously forming 
        new ones.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Proverbs 29:18:&nbsp; &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish.&quot;&nbsp; 
        Stoltz says that to overcome adversity in a sustained way, one must 
        first dream the dream, then make the dream into a vision, and then 
        sustain the vision, hold on to it, and not let it go.&nbsp; P. 287:&nbsp; 
        &quot;AQ is not a quick fix, but rather an enduring formula built 
        on a fundamental truth that life is hard--but how you handle it determines 
        your destiny.&quot;&nbsp; Recall the discussion above of Frankl:&nbsp; 
        even though life is filled with suffering, guilt, and death, individuals 
        can still derive meaning from their pain and suffering.&nbsp; Because 
        of vision, people know the joy of &quot;life is beautiful:&nbsp; &quot;As 
        long as one is alive, they can ascend.&quot;</p>

    <li>The model &quot;Managing<a name="Managing"></a> Conflict for Individual 
      &amp; Team Success At Home and At School,&quot; presented to the Wilson 
      Cluster Parent Connection, May 13, 1997, by Sam Imperati, Executive 
      Director for The Institute for Conflict Management, Inc., and JoAnn 
      Hjouck, Mediator, Solomon's Tree.&nbsp; This model begins with the reality 
      that &quot;conflict arises in all relationships,&quot; that conflict 
      arises when someone insists they are right and you are wrong, and that 
      the goal is to avoid the &quot;standard&quot; model, stated tongue in 
      cheek, of &quot;I'll listen to your unreasonable demands if you'll consider 
      my unacceptable offer,&quot; and that to succeed in conflict resolution, 
      even between two people, those involved must act as a team even when 
      they come from different places/organizations/families/schools, etc.&nbsp; 
      And although not a replacement for the traditional legal process, it 
      can compliment it by providing a creative, economical and effective 
      alternative to expensive law suits.&nbsp; This means that those in conflict 
      but build relationships, not a case, and that they must understand that 
      they are to fix a problem not fix blame.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This model has four steps: </li>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <li> Identify the problem by getting both sides to understand what 
          the other's position(s) and argument(s) is/are and to recognize 
          that they can solve the problem.</li>
        <li> Explore the problem by looking at the underlying values, needs, 
          and interests of each party, identifying what each has in common, 
          and then exploring the best case-worst case scenarios regarding 
          the consequences of not reaching a resolution.&nbsp;</li>
        <li> Develop solutions by listing all possible solutions, and then 
          exploring the options in terms of which solutions satisfy common 
          interests (O.P.T.I.O.N.S.:&nbsp; only proposals that include others' 
          needs succeed).&nbsp;</li>
        <li> Select and implement a solution by negotiating a winning solution 
          that will generate full support now and in the future, and not ending 
          without laying out procedures to follow if what is worked out worsens 
          or, for whatever reason, the agreement reached is not working.FIFTH:&nbsp; 
          the Lists/Recipes for empowering both sides to achieve success model, 
          compiled by Peter J. Jessen.&nbsp; As human beings have no instincts 
          for social interaction (Berger's phrase), they &quot;create instinct 
          substitutes&quot; (Gehlen's phrase).&nbsp;<br>

          more prevalent as a reflection of the realities of life than &quot;when 
          I get energized and feel great&quot; I will get going.&nbsp; This 
          must be the attitude of any who would overcome adversity and anyone 
          who would engage in the &quot;school mission marathon&quot; to answer 
          the questions before us, let along the attitude that must be in 
          the heads of both students and teachers/administrators, if all of 
          them are to get the most out of the K-12 educational experience 
          marathon.&nbsp; Lists/recipes for action are key to organizing the 
          thoughts and actions one needs to achieve goals.<br>

          of Highly Effective People and Families,&quot; Benjamin Franklin's 
          list of 13 areas for achieving personal and professional success, 
          the list of Dale Carnegie's success principles, the list of success 
          principles of Napoleon Hill and W. Clement Stone, 6 lists for goal 
          setting by Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, Robert Schuller, Peter Daniels, 
          Paul Stoltz, and Napoleon Hill, as well as a list of books of lists

    <li>The Lists/Recipes<a name="Recipes"></a> for empowering both sides 
      to achieve success model, compiled by Peter J. Jessen. As human beings 
      have no instincts for social interaction (Berger's phrase), they &quot;create 
      instinct substitutes&quot; (Arnold Gehlen's phrase). They create habits. 
      These habits are said to follow the recipes needed for success. People 
      seek &quot;recipe knowledge&quot; (Alfred Schutz's phrase).<br>
      <br>
      It derives from three concepts: (1) the social fact that humans have 
      no instincts for human interaction nor for keeping track of things, 
      and that to survive, must create &quot;instinct substitutes,&quot; which 
      are call roles. Every situation in which any person finds themselves, 
      is a stage, and each stage has its own called for role playing, behavior, 
      costume, etc. No one can live a role free existence. (2), because of 
      this, anyone can, individually and collectively, be a playwright and 
      participate in creating the stages on which they play, and the plays 
      in which they play their roles. (3), individuals are capable of not 
      only living in multiple realities AND are capable of emigrating freely 
      back and forth between them. Nothing, therefore, is inevitable. All 
      can be negotiated, worked out (except in those cases where individuals 
      or groups choose not to.<br>
      <br>
      This also means that role playing is more important than one's feelings, 
      that no matter how one feels, the old theatre adage that &quot;the show 
      must go on&quot; is far more prevalent as a reflection of the realities 
      of life than &quot;when I get energized and feel great&quot; I will

    </li>
    <li>The &quot;Love<a name="Love"></a> each other&quot; model, as admonished 
      by Jesus, the Buddha, and sometimes Mohammed, is a universal, regardless 
      of religion.&nbsp; Hannah Arendt says the human condition requires forgiving 
      others, as words and deeds are irreversible, and keeping promises, as 
      that keeps chaos at bay.&nbsp; Christians celebrate the Jewish Passover 
      as Maundy Thursday (Maundy having roots from three languages:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      derived from mandatum, Latin, &quot;commandment&quot;; also derived 
      from the English, &quot;Mandate&quot;; and derived from the French, 
      &quot;Mande,&quot; meaning &quot;command&quot; or &quot;mandate&quot;).&nbsp; 
      For some, it refers to Jesus foot washing of his disciples and His command 
      to serve one another.&nbsp; To others it refers to his command to love 
      one another (both of which are common to all peoples of the Book:&nbsp; 
      Christians, Jews, Moslems).&nbsp; To me it refers to and includes both.&nbsp; 
      Or, as the liturgy at http://www.rockies.net/~spirit/sermons/s-maundy-thursday.html 
      states it:<br>
      <br>
      MAUNDY is an English form of the Latin word for commandment. The overarching 
      theme of Maundy Thursday is Jesus' new commandment, given on this the 
      eve of his death, to &quot;love one another even as I have loved you&quot; 
      (John 13:34) Maundy Thursday is the night of the final meal that Jesus 
      had with his disciples. The night in which he washed his disciples feet, 
      saying after he had done so: (John 13:12-17) &quot;Do you understand 
      what I have done for you? You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly 
      so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed 
      your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an 
      example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, 
      no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than 
      the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed 
      if you do them.<br>
      <br>
      What makes the events of 9/11/01 so mystifying for many, is that all 
      three religions who share and are all three called &quot;The Peoples 
      of The Book,&quot; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, have members with 
      different interpretations and who thus have adopted roles not of loving 
      and serving but of hating and killing.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The &quot;Serve<a name="Serve"></a> others model&quot;, as admonished 
      by Jesus, the Buddha, and Mohammed.&nbsp; Albert Schweitzer said:&nbsp; 
      &quot;I don' know what you will do in life, but I do know you won't 
      be happy until you learn to serve others.&quot;<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Putting top individuals of conflicting organizations in the anchoring 
      environment of a Round<a name="Round"></a> Table, as was used by King 
      Author for his Knights of the Round Table, in order to get them to act 
      cooperatively together, and as was used by Katherine Graham, Publisher 
      of The Washington Post, to foster open communications where suspicioned 
      communications existed before. (just as its counter part, in macro, 
      is on a formal basis).</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>The forgiveness model for reconciliation of Jewish scholar, Hannah 
      Arendt<a name="Arendt"></a>.<br>
      <br>
      In Macro #5 above, we read: In her book, The Human Condition, the Jewish 
      scholar Hannah Arendt says we keep chaos at bay by keeping promises 
      and that we deal with the irreversibility of our words and deeds through 
      forgiveness, that forgiveness and reconciliation are not the provenance 
      of Christians, although Jesus emphasizes it more than anyone, but rather 
      that both are necessary because of the &quot;human condition.&quot; 
      To forgive in order to be reconciled requires loving. Love is what is 
      missing in the Middle East's Oslo Accords. Without love, it will ultimately 
      fail.<br>
      <br>
      We are also reminded in Micro #6 of Hannah Arendt's insight that the 
      human condition is such that we are not perfect, and that we do and 
      say things we wish we did not say or do. Once said or done it is irreversible. 
      Therefore, all we can do if we want to stay in positive human relationships 
      is to reconcile through forgiveness. Apologizing also helps. The best 
      reconciliation comes when whoever should be apologizing does and who 
      ever should be forgiving does. But if there is no apology, forgiveness 
      is still required to be a human being free of the oppression of anger 
      and holding grudges against others. Why? Because, again, words and deeds 
      are irreversible.<br>
      <br>
      Confessing and forgiveness are easier when we keep our promises, as 
      that, she says, helps to keep chaos at bay. This fits handily with Archbishop 
      Tutu's Ubuntu Theology of Forgiveness model (Macro #9). Too often we 
      hate first and stay that way and thus love gets lost, and the chances 
      of reconciliation are lost as well, causing fights among individuals 
      at the micro level and war between countries at the macro level. Ironically, 
      those most often calling for peace (think of the anti-war movement regarding 
      our Civil War or regarding Vietnam or Iraq) or calling for people to 
      do good (think of the far right attacks against Bill Clinton and the 
      far left attacks against George W. Bush). Arendt says it is too bad 
      that forgiveness is seen as a Jesus thing, as all peoples, all cultures, 
      all religions need to be in reconciliation, as it is part of what is 
      needed to deal effectively with the human condition of imperfection.<br>
      <br>
      Jesus, she said, just said it best. Those who can't forgive cannot be 
      reconciled and those who can't or won't be reconciled can't or won't 
      love, and set the stage for continued conflict. Conflict resolution 
      requires reconciliation which is always easier when there is at least 
      an element of love involved. And love, admonished Jesus (and sometimes 
      Buddha and Mohammed), is what makes harmony among people and peoples 
      possible. This, along with others is a sober and clear-sighted example 
      of spiritual politics at its best. Best rule? The Golden Rule.<br>
      An excellent source of &quot;lists/recipes&quot; is any program based 
      on &quot;six sigma&quot;, the concept behind the concept of TQM (total 
      quality management), which is to minimize errors and, thus, defects.&nbsp; 
      Although designed for organizations as a whole, it also designed for 
      use individually, and can be used by such disparate organizations as 
      manufacturing plants and public schools.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="style1"><br>
    <strong>A &quot;P.S.&quot; to these 8 macro and 8 micro models for conflict 
      resolution</strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><br>
    Note that the 2 KEYS to all of these 18 models is their organization.&nbsp; 
    It is recommended that their organizational principle be that of (1) &nbsp;L-I-S-T-S/R-E-C-I-P-E-S) 
    (as part of goals, plans, contingencies, time lines), and (2) c-o-l-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-I-o-n 
    (with all as negotiable).</p>
  <p class="style1">As Berger further points out, social scientists talk about 
    the reality that &quot;every society has its own corpus of officially 
    accredited wisdom, the beliefs and values that most people take for granted 
    as self-evidently true.&quot;&nbsp; In terms of education, there are multiple 
    realities involved, each viewing education differently, from the unique 
    position of its own prism of reality.&nbsp; This was not the case &quot;in 
    the old days&quot;, when, as Berger writes:&nbsp; &quot;Every human society 
    has institutions and functionaries whose task it is to represent this 
    putative truth, to transmit it to each new generation, to engage in rituals 
    that reaffirm it, and sometimes to deal (at least in words) with those 
    who are benighted or wicked enough to deny it.&quot;&nbsp; This used to 
    be an easy task when there was a dominant set of beliefs and values that 
    everyone took for granted.&nbsp; But modern society is pluralistic, with 
    multiple realities or worldviews that change, hence the saying of W.R. 
    Inage, that &quot;he who would marry the spirit of the age soon becomes 
    a widower.&quot;</p>
  <p class="style1"> There are two other organizing principles which recommend 
    for consideration by both the macro models and the micro models, both 
    suggested by Peter Berger.&nbsp; The first is a &quot;calculus of meaning&quot; 
    and a &quot;calculus of pain,&quot; from his book Pyramids of Sacrifice:&nbsp; 
    Political Ethics and Social Change, in which he suggests that policies 
    should be those which provide the most meaning and the least pain, and 
    that each calculus include a list of outcomes that are not desirable, 
    in order to avoid the mistake of believing because the intent is pure, 
    so will be the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="style1">Secondly, adapting from another analytical framework of 
    Peter Berger, it is recommended that each of the stakeholders in the discussions 
    that ensue review whether or not they are arguing from an ideological 
    position or not, whether they are actually flexible with their thinking, 
    and to ascertain whether or not they are being &quot;historically specific 
    conservatives&quot; or &quot;historically non-specific conservatives.&quot; </p>
  <p class="style1">This eliminates the argument over content labels (liberal 
    vs. conservative, Democrat vs. Republican), and instead focuses on the 
    process.&nbsp; In this way, it can be state that both the radical left 
    and the radical right are, hopelessly and romantically, historically specific 
    conservatives.&nbsp; The radical left looks forward to a future putative 
    utopia which, when reached, is to be frozen in place, never to change, 
    because utopia has been achieved.&nbsp; The radical right looks backward 
    to a putative golden age which it wishes to resurrect, after which it 
    too is to be frozen in place, as the golden age has been retrieved.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="style1">The historically NON-specific conservative recognizes 
    yet resists the impulse to fine a &quot;good place&quot; and to then rest 
    and keep it that way, but also recognizes that it is better to make haste 
    slowly, and that as most historical actions have unintended consequences, 
    one needs to be slow in assuming that a proposed policy or action is the 
    solution.&nbsp; The Spanish Civil War, which, like all wars, was a conflict 
    &quot;full of moral ambiguities, with unspeakable brutality on both sides,&quot; 
    in which a monument has been erected to the million who died, a monument 
    placed inside a mountain not far from &quot;The Valley of the Fallen&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="style1"> Berger's chilling words about this should give us all 
    pause and inspire us to be &quot;historically non-specific conservatives&quot;:&nbsp; 
    &nbsp;&quot;And the Spain that is now emerging has nothing to do with 
    what either side fought and died for.&quot; Or, as Cassidy put it in his 
    book, &quot;Apartheid and all its works will pass away.&nbsp; So will 
    every answer which replaces it, whether better and nobler or yet more 
    sinful and worse.&quot;</p>
