  <p><b>19.&nbsp; LISTS for achieving success by raising your Adversity Quotient</b><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    In his book Adversity Quotient:&nbsp; Turning Obstacles into Opportunities, 
    Paul G. Stoltz introduces us to his concept of AQ, measures how one responds 
    to adversity.&nbsp; Most respond to adversity in one of three ways:&nbsp; 
    by quitting (&quot;quitters&quot;), by settling (&quot;campers&quot;), 
    or by resisting it and continuing on to one's goal (&quot;climbers&quot;).&nbsp; 
    Adversity takes place on three levels: individually, workplace, and societal.&nbsp; 
    &quot;AQ is a new conceptual framework for understanding and enhancing 
    all facets of success&quot; (p. 7,).&nbsp; The higher the AQ for a person 
    or an organization, the greater the competitive advantage and the greater 
    the ability to persevere through continuous change&quot; (p. 277).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Follow <b>CO2RE</b> (pp. 106-114):&nbsp; Control, Origin and Ownership, 
    Reach, and Endurance to gain control (empower self) over adversity, gain 
    appropriate perspective on the adversity (see light at the end of the 
    tunnel), including taking appropriate responsibility, in order to limit 
    the reach (impact) and endurance (perceived control) of adverse events.&nbsp; 
    The book is based on over 500 studies since the landmark work of Martin 
    Seligman on &quot;learned helplessness&quot; (considered by the American 
    Psychological Association to be the Landmark Theory of the Century, as 
    it explains why people give up or stop short of their goals, be they leaders 
    or followers).&nbsp; <br>
    This theory, and how it can be used to overcome the feeling of helplessness, 
    is the &quot;most significant ingredient in the formation of AQ&quot; 
    (p. 54).&nbsp; Learned helplessness &quot;is simply internalizing the 
    belief that what you do does not matter, sapping one's sense of control&quot; 
    (p. 55).&nbsp; In his book Learned Optimism:&nbsp; How to Change Your 
    Mind and Your Life, Seligman explains how to get out of &quot;learned 
    helplessness&quot;.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    In his book Adversity Quotient, Paul Stoltz shows how to raise AQ immediately, 
    such that it can generate instant results which can be made permanent.&nbsp; 
    AQ takes the person from &quot;learned helplessness&quot; (the definitive 
    barrier to empowerment) to &quot;learned optimism,&quot; which yields 
    empowerment.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The three building blocks of AQ are cognitive psychology (how one responds 
    influences effectiveness/performance/success); neurophysiology (response 
    habits can be interrupted and instantly changed); and psychoneuroimmunology 
    (how one responds impacts on health).&nbsp; The good news:&nbsp; habits 
    can be changed instantaneously.&nbsp; To keep the new habit requires practice.&nbsp; 
    One gets from helplessness and hopelessness to hopefulness and helpfulness 
    in three stages (see below).&nbsp; Life&#146;s bottom line:&nbsp; life 
    is hard.&nbsp; How you handle it determines your destiny.&nbsp; Thus, 
    AQ provides &quot;a mechanism to fortify ourselves and those around us 
    to break free of the cycle of despair and begin to reignite the essential 
    element of hope.&nbsp; &#133;&nbsp; With it, there are no limits to what 
    we can do.&nbsp; It all begins with you--the individual--and your ability 
    to get past the adversity&quot; (p. 287).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &#149;&nbsp; List of 3 stages, p. 285-287:&nbsp; (1) Dreaming the Dream 
    (higher AQs allow imaging of greater possibilities); (2) Making the Dream 
    the Vision (higher AQs take action on the dream, recognizing the need 
    to separate out the possible realties and sacrifices and then work accordingly; 
    and (3) Sustaining the Vision (able to continue the ascent of the climb 
    without being distracted or taken off the path; higher AQs are fueled 
    by the relentless effort required to forge ahead.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &#149;&nbsp; List of 15 levels of profiles reflecting AQ from low to high, 
    pp. 128-137.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &#149;&nbsp; Low:&nbsp; &quot;It's all my fault, and I couldn't help it.&nbsp; 
    Everything's falling apart, it'll never change, and there's nothing I 
    can do about it.&nbsp; Someone had better come in and pick up the pieces.&quot; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &#149;&nbsp; High:&nbsp; &quot;I can see what went wrong and how I could 
    do a better job next time.&nbsp; I am accountable for dealing with this, 
    so I look forward to taking immediate action to limit both the reach of 
    the adversity and how long this difficult situation will endure, while 
    learning from the challenge.&quot;<br>

    260-263)</p>
