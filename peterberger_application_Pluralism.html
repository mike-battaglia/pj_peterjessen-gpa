    <p>Key Principles of Peter L. Berger:&nbsp;Vis a Vis Sociology of and the  Sociology of Knowledge as they Relate to Social Roles, Social Stratification, Social  Inequality, and Justice, Peter J. Jessen, Reader, 1993</p>
    <h3>Peace: Berger's &quot;The Political Management of Pluralism&quot; — &quot;Golden Rule&quot; Godly, as if &quot;God Didn't Exist&quot;</h3>
    <p>Peter Jessen, 4-1-16, West Side Singles  Ministry, 7-9 pm, Topic asked to speak on:<strong> Peace/Galatians 5:22 &amp; Isaiah 43:1-7)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>PEACE:  in Five Parts:</strong></p>
    <p class="aligncenter"><strong>&ldquo;The political management of pluralism,&rdquo;  Berger, <em>Altars…</em>, pp79-93)</strong>  <strong> </strong></p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Peace!</li>
      <li>Fear not! </li>
      <li>The fruits       of the spirit can lead to Peace and No Fears / management of fears, and       are the <strong>keys to personal inner</strong> <strong>peace</strong> with self, with others and       in establishing world peace interactively between institutions and between       nations.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Jesus devoted       nearly every waking moment to helping us rid our lives of fear,&rdquo; Peter W.       Marty.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1.</strong><strong> Getting to know each other</strong><br>
      I am a consultant and college/university  teacher who applies sociological understanding and interpretations to management  consulting, job hunting / motivation, leadership, sports leagues and revenue,  stadiums/local $$development.  Masters  and doctoral work in sociology (Sociology of knowledge, Sociology of religion,  Social roles, Social Change, Social Movements).   More background/bio points at <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/about">www.peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/about</a>) <br>
      2 years NFL; 2  yrs UFL; NYC (Consultant to Companies, individuals); DC: Consultant to  companies, think tanks, and government:  White  House, Senate, House of Reps, Pentagon, agencies.<br>
      Published 3 books,  many articles, edit web site,  edit Black  activist&rsquo;s weekly column for a weekly Black newspaper.<br>
  <strong>YOU:  in one sentence:   </strong>What are your fears? What keeps you from  being at peace? What are your main fruits?</p>
    <p><strong>PEOPLES&rsquo;  FEARS:  </strong>Surveys show a tie at #1:  snakes and public speaking<strong></strong><br>
      Others:  flying, heights, death and dying, cancer,  debilitating disease, growing old, loneliness, failure, homeland security.  Fears and phobias;  anxiety and worry,  real and imaginary.  Galatians shows how to achieve &ldquo;fear not.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Who  coined &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; and what was the cost?  Mao Zedong, 50 million people.  Not a formula of peace</strong><br>
      See Starbucks&rsquo; PC list (handouts)<strong>:</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> choose his unity; <strong>(2)</strong> choose his PC  column not un-PC column (WSJ,  3-14-16, p A9&amp;10)</p>
    <p><strong>PEACE  sought in 2 kinds of &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; approaches:  </strong><br>
      <strong>(1) </strong>mine or yours -- whoever gets their way  over the other;<strong> (2) ours, </strong>arrived  collaboratively through reciprocal dialectics<br>
      <strong>1.  Berger&rsquo;s &ldquo;historically specific conservative&rdquo;</strong>  (<strong>past</strong> <strong>utopias</strong> to be resurrected;  <strong>future</strong> <strong>utopias</strong> to be created), both false.<br>
      Whether left or right:  achieve politically correct society and freeze  it in place: frozen freedom for all, no more change. i.e. &ldquo;The End of history:  &rdquo; George Hegel &amp; Karl Marx, 19th  century, Daniel Bell and Francis Fukyama, 20th century.<br>
  <strong>2.  Berger&rsquo;s &ldquo;historically non-specific  conservative&rdquo;</strong> (&ldquo;make haste slowly&rdquo; and adapt to reciprocal interactive reactions)<br>
      Freedom of self,  liberty of universals (which is why the &ldquo;specifics&rdquo; of left &amp; right don&rsquo;t  like the U.S. constitution)</p>
    <p><strong>OVERCOMING  FEARS TO GET TO PEACE</strong><br>
      <strong>1st  statement of fear in Bible:</strong>  Adam to God  when he and Eve went into hiding;  &ldquo;I heard you and I was afraid.&rdquo;<br>
      <strong>&ldquo;Fear  not&rdquo;:The most common command</strong> <strong>in  the Bible</strong>, 366 times  (either as &ldquo;fear not&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid).<br>
      <strong>Sermon  on the Mount:</strong>  Maritain:  it shows how to deal with suffering and be  consoled in the midst of suffering so as to get to the fruit of  &ldquo;peace, love, joy,&rdquo; making the effort &ldquo;to go  beyond the human condition in order to achieve real fruition&rdquo; (be a grown up,  support families, be an &ldquo;Imitation of Christ&rdquo;).   Consider:  happiness comes from  doing one&rsquo;s duty.</p>
    <p><strong>Hand out </strong>the 3 p. handout with Starbucks  statement and PC list.</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians:  absolute contemporary relevance</strong> due to the <strong>unchanging nature of man:  God given free will, choice</strong>.  <br>
      The  law (compliance to rules, style or practices) can&rsquo;t save man.  Only God&rsquo;s free grace in Jesus Christ can.  Hence Martin Luther&rsquo;s:  <strong>no  kings, no popes, no councils</strong>.  One&rsquo;s  own self&rsquo;s conscience with God.<br>
  <strong>Thucydides:    5th  century B.C.:   &ldquo;</strong>It will be enough for me ... if these words of mine are judged useful by  those&nbsp;who want to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;clearly the events which happened  in the past and which&nbsp;<strong>(human nature  being what it is)</strong> will, at some time or other and in much the same  ways,&nbsp;<strong>be repeated in the future</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>This is the challenge of the &ldquo;specifics,&rdquo; left and  right</strong>: &nbsp;how to deal with the fact that nothing is new  and that positive change comes from not repeating negatives, which happens when  we don&rsquo;t realize we are making mistakes others have made. &nbsp;<strong>Key question:</strong>  how to avoid PC totalitarian impulses from:   &ldquo;this&rdquo;  is the &ldquo;only&rdquo; way and &ldquo;everyone must&rdquo; follow?</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians  and Paul&rsquo;s letters reflects the truth </strong>of the Church as the Body of Christ and  its function, activity, and destiny, through Faith given by Grace.  Not legalism or literalism but God&rsquo;s free  grace in Jesus Christ.  Legalism and laws  can&rsquo;t save man from sin. Work&rsquo;s righteousness (usually done in far away lands  or cities) follows rigid laws, is often blind to unintended consequences (e.g.,  &ldquo;good policy&rdquo; too often leaves people poor &amp; hungry and lacking in peace &amp;  joy. This attitude often derails churches today &amp; renders them more and  more irrelevant the more they forget the unity of all.</p>
    <p><strong>Human nature being what it is, we are needful of God&rsquo;s grace.  <u>From Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Second Inaugural</u>:</strong>  READ ALTOGETHER:  South and North &ldquo;Both  read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against  the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's  assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let  us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered.  That of neither has been answered fully.   Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war  may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth  piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be  sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by  another drawn with the sword,&rdquo; as God&rsquo;s children on each side pray to God for  Him to kill His children on the other side.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong><strong>  <u>Galatians  5:22:  fruit of the spirit.</u>  Recall John 15:8:  &ldquo;that you bear much fruit.&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Galatians  5:  </strong>The nature of Christian freedom.</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians  5:14:  </strong>For the whole law is summed up in  a single commandment:  &ldquo;you shall love  your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians  5:15:</strong>  &ldquo;If, however, you bite and devour one  another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong> Galatians 5:19-21:  Fruit of <u>Flesh</u> (as opposed to the  Spirit) is not a formula of peace, but rather destroys peace. </strong>Paul<strong> </strong>enumerates vices that lead to falls  from grace and, thus, falls from God<strong>:  &ldquo;</strong>fornication, impurity, licentiousness,  idolatry, sorcery, enmities strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions,  factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing….  I am warning you, as I warned you before:  those who do such things will not inherit the  kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians  5:22:  Fruit of the <u>Spirit</u> enables  peace, the direction to go for personal and world peace:  fruit as in &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in growth:  &ldquo;</strong>love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity,  and self-control.  …  live by the Spirit…be guided by the Spirit.  Let us not become conceited, competing  against one another, envying one another.&rdquo;  <br>
      6:2:   &ldquo;…bear one another&rsquo;s burdens.&rdquo;<br>
      Being &ldquo;led by the Spirit&rdquo; (v. 18) in  Christian freedom yields the &ldquo;fruit of the Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22)</p>
    <p><strong>Galatians</strong> was considered  by Protestant reformers as the &ldquo;Magna Carta of Christian Freedom,&rdquo; a formal  declaration by the apostle Paul of liberty in Jesus Christ.  &ldquo;<strong>Freedom&rdquo;</strong> is voted on (temporal); freedom still allows majorities to dispose of, avoid,  or place obstacles before minorities.   But &ldquo;<strong>liberty&rdquo; is universal</strong>, given  by God and therefore cannot be taken away, which was the basis for writing the  constitution the way it was written.  &ldquo;Human  nature being what it is,&rdquo; man tends to seek self-justification through works of  the law and &ldquo;following&rdquo; the law.  That is  much easier than following the gospel.     Galatians is absolutely relevant to our day and points out the danger  that exists due to the unchangeability of man&rsquo;s nature.</p>
    <p><strong>Hence  Galatians is held to be one of Paul&rsquo;s greatest and most important letters</strong>.  Also called &ldquo;a short Romans.&rdquo;  <br>
      As noted, in the Reformation era it became  &ldquo;the Magna Carta of spiritual emancipation.&rdquo;  </p>
    <p><strong>Merrill  Tenney has stated,</strong> &ldquo;Few books have had a more profound influence on the history of mankind than  has this small, six chapter tract.&rdquo;  It  became &ldquo;the cornerstone of the Protestant Reformation,&rdquo; because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s teaching  of salvation by grace alone became the dominant theme of the preaching of the  Reformers.&rdquo;  <strong>Key question:</strong>  how to live by  faith?  Galatians is the guide for how to  live:  a release from the bondage of  religious externalism (Galatians 3:11:   Now it is evident that &ldquo;no one is justified before God by the law,&rdquo; for  &ldquo;The one who is righteous will live by faith.&rdquo;). </p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong><strong>  Read</strong> <strong>Isaiah 43:1-7:  to comfort God&rsquo;s people:  God will not abandon us, but is here to  redeem us.</strong><br>
      Columbus believed himself commissioned  by God to make his voyage, based on Isaiah 42:1-7.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Through the many dangers, toils and snares through which we have  already come.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>His <strong><u>grace</u></strong> has  brought us safe thus far.&nbsp; And his grace will lead us home.</li>
      <li><strong>Let  these salvation promises be our comfort:&nbsp;</strong> READ  TOGETHER AS DIRECTED:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FEAR  NOT (for PEACE), because I have redeemed you.   (v1)</strong><strong> </strong></li>
      <li>Future  redemption <strong>in  the perfect past tense, </strong>pre-paid  (called <strong>the  &ldquo;prophetic perfect&rdquo;). </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Paid  big price:  God&rsquo;s son Jesus; before:  redeemed after flood; redeemed from slavery  in Egypt</strong></li>
      <li><strong>&ldquo;Redeemed&rdquo;  occurs 13 times in chaps 40-66</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Martin  Luther re Creed:  1st </strong>article:  &ldquo;I believe God has created me,&rdquo;  </li>
      <li><strong>Martin  Luther re Creed:  </strong>2nd  article: I believe God has &ldquo;redeemed me, a lost &amp; condemned human being.&rdquo; </li>
      <li><strong>It  is not <u>if</u> but <u>when</u> and <u>as</u> we pass through the flood  waters,  v2</strong></li>
      <li>We pass through many struggles, some unimaginable, from A to Z,  from water to fire, every natural and spiritual disaster possible,   We   should let nothing stop our journeys.:  &ldquo;For I will be with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should let  nothing stop us from reaching our journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear not, I am with  you.&rdquo; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FEAR  NOT (for PEACE), because I have called you by name.  (v1)</strong><strong> </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Calling  us out of spiritual exile and on to a journey home</strong>.  [PEACE] </li>
      <li>No matter how long or lonely our struggle, we have not been  abandoned in our misery.</li>
      <li>He has fully paid for all our sins.&nbsp; And He will keep his  promise to bring us safely home.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FEAR  NOT (to get PEACE), because I am with you always.&nbsp;  (v1)</strong><strong> </strong></li>
      <li>Long and dangerous journey.&nbsp; A journey with many potholes  and detours and side tracks that slow our progress and threaten to stop us in  our tracks </li>
      <li>With <strong>many potholes and  detours and side tracks that slow our progress and threaten to stop us in our  tracks</strong></li>
      <li><strong>John  Bunyan </strong>has written the classic story of our dangerous journey home, <strong><u>Pilgrim's Progress</u></strong>, the main  character, <strong>Christian, leaves the City of  Destruction in search of the Celestial City</strong> … gets off detour, must <strong>climb the hill of difficulty</strong>, <strong>sweating, struggling, and fighting the  temptation to turn back</strong> from his dangerous journey. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>SHEDDING FEAR IS A FRUIT:</u></strong>  Through <strong>many  dangers, toils, snares</strong>, i.e., <strong>suffering</strong>,  His <strong><u>grace</u> brings us through. </strong>His  grace will lead us home.&nbsp; <strong>These are  salvation promises for our personal comfort:&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>FEAR       NOT:  PEACE TO YOU:  for I have redeemed you. </li>
      <li>FEAR       NOT:  PEACE TO YOU:  for I have called you by name. </li>
      <li>FEAR       NOT:  PEACE TO YOU:  for I am with you always.&nbsp; Amen </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>4.</strong><strong>  Apply Galatians  &amp; Isaiah to the concept of <u>pluralism</u></strong>, from Peter Berger&rsquo;s  2014 book, <strong><em>The Many Altars of Modernity.</em></strong><br>
      Berger&rsquo;s &ldquo;pluralism&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;a simple  description of social facts&rdquo; of the &ldquo;<strong>plurality</strong>&rdquo;  of reality, rather than ideological.  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Its  not &ldquo;religion vs. secular&rdquo; but BOTH religion AND secular.  Sect = denominations, ideologies.  Secular = science, technology, institutional/bureaucratic  management/&ldquo;best practices&rdquo; (e.g., Hindu pilot flies as secular, not Hindu) </li>
      <li>Berger discusses <strong>&ldquo;formulas of peace&rdquo;</strong> for the purpose of enabling <strong>&ldquo;the  political management of pluralism&rdquo; pp79-93)</strong>   &ldquo;cognitive bargaining&rdquo; enabling &ldquo;<strong>co-existence of different religions  in the same society&rdquo;</strong> (not to mention different ideologies).  Let&rsquo;s extend it; use  different nouns other than &ldquo;religions&rdquo;, e.g.  &ldquo;race&rdquo; &ldquo;political parties&rdquo; &ldquo;ethnic,&rdquo; &ldquo;gender&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Very  religious &ldquo;17th century Dutch jurist <strong>Hugo Grotius</strong> proposed <strong>new  discipline of international law</strong> should be developed <strong>&ldquo;as if God were not given,&rdquo;  </strong>as  if he<strong> &ldquo;did not exist.&rdquo;</strong>  This influenced the enlightenment, USA,  French, and UN formulas.  Berger:  &ldquo;it can also be applied beyond the institution  of law to the state…the market economy…any bureaucracy.&rdquo;  This <strong>&ldquo;management  of pluralism,&rdquo;</strong> can enable <strong>avoiding  &ldquo;relativism&rsquo;s…moral nihilism&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;fundamentalism&rsquo;s  fanaticism&rdquo;</strong> in order to avoid religious wars, ideological conflicts, and,  thus, achieve peace. </li>
      <li>Again, we live  in BOTH a religious age AND a secular age:   pluralism as plurality.  Berger  outlines <strong>Formulas of Peace</strong> to avoid  war by <strong>&ldquo;The Management of Pluralism.&rdquo;</strong> <strong>Western</strong> (e.g. territorial of the  Holy Roman Empire; 1555 Diet of Augsburg / 1648 Peace of Westphalia (&ldquo;he who  rules decides the religion&rdquo;); USA Constitution of religious liberty and  France&rsquo;s separation of church and state).  <strong>Non-Western</strong> (e.g. indifference of ancient Rome; Millet of the Bible &amp; the Ottoman Turks,  India&rsquo;s absorption, Islam&rsquo;s subordination), to be integrated into my <a href="http://www.beacononthehillsportsmarketing.com/pages/18models.htm">18 Conflict Resolution Models</a></li>
      <li>Modern world:  pluralism:  a common feature, with diverse denominations &amp; religious traditions occupying  same space. </li>
      <li>Modern world: pluralism: of mind &amp; practice involving BOTH the  religious AND the secular, thus:  &ldquo;<strong>differentiation</strong>&rdquo; between secular &amp;  religious institutions. AND:  &ldquo;Basic  insight of sociology of knowledge:  If [institutions  are] to function in society, every institution must have a correlate in  consciousness ....<strong> differentiation</strong> must also be manifested in the consciousness of individuals&rdquo; (again, the Hindu  pilot&rsquo;s &ldquo;multiple realities&rdquo; and multiple &ldquo;relevance structures&rdquo;).  <strong>Key  question for peace</strong>:  why, as  empirically socialism doesn&rsquo;t work, it is still pursued?</li>
      <li> &ldquo;The American constitution gets it essentially  right: a religiously neutral state with some form of freedom of religion is the  most efficient way of handling the question of religious freedom.&rdquo;  [and ideologies]</li>
      <li>Samuel  Huntington&rsquo;s &ldquo;clash of civilizations&rdquo; thesis is correct only with Islam vs the  world, with Islam yet to join the rest in seeking formulas of peace so religious  &amp; secularisms can coexist peaceably in modernization &amp; globalization.</li>
