  <p>A few years ago, Monsanto Co. had the future in its pocket. The vast 
    life-sciences company promised a revolution in agriculture so profound 
    it would eliminate age-old obstacles to increasing the quality and quantity 
    of the world's food supply. The spread of its genetically modified seeds 
    throughout the US, former chairman Robert Shapiro told shareholders, 
    was the most &quot;successful launch of any technology ever, including 
    the plow.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
  <p> <b>But</b> when Monsanto president and CEO Hendrik Verfaillie stood 
    at a podium in Washington last November to deliver &quot;A New Pledge 
    for a New Company,&quot; it was <b>a humbling moment</b>. &quot;We are 
    making a new start as a company completely devoted to agriculture,&quot; 
    explained Verfaillie. &quot;And we are doing this at a time when a shift 
    in society <b>-- a shift that started perhaps 40 years ago -- is approaching 
      full maturity. That shift has been a movement from a 'trust-me' society 
      to a 'show-me' society.&quot; &nbsp;</b></p>
  <p> The speech, ostensibly about Monsanto's recent merger with Pharmacia 
    Corp., also was <b>an act of contrition.</b> After <b>intense pressure</b> from environmentalists, shoppers, food retailers, and farmers, and <b>an 
      international furor that hit Monsanto's stock like a hailstorm</b>, 
    the company <b>was forced to concede defeat</b> for what critics called 
    a decade long fight to aggressively force its line of bioengineered 
    agriculture products into world markets. &nbsp;</p>
  <p> As Verfaillie announced the &quot;New Pledge&quot; -- <b>a set of 
    principles</b> in five key areas outlining Monsanto's policy for the <b>development, use, and stewardship of products</b> of new agricultural 
    technologies -- <b>he explained how the company misread public opinion 
      in the years that led up to that moment</b>. &nbsp;</p>
  <p> &quot;Monsanto focused so much attention on getting the technology 
    right for our customer -- the grower -- that <b>we didn't fully take 
      into account the issues and concerns it raised for other people</b>,&quot; 
    Verfaillie admitted. &quot;We didn't understand that when it comes to 
    a serious public concern, that <b>the</b> <b>more you stand to make 
      a profit in the marketplace, the less credibility you have in the marketplace 
      of ideas.</b> When we tried to explain the benefits, the science, and 
    the safety, we did not understand that our tone -- our very approach 
    -- was seen as arrogant. We were still in the 'trust-me' mode when the 
    expectation was 'show me.' &nbsp;
    <o:p></o:p>
  </p>
  <p style='margin-right:-27.0pt'>Like Monsanto,<b> more and more companies 
    are being forced to the podium of public accountability </b>-- the result 
    of powerful grassroots interests that have grown highly suspicious of 
    large corporations. <b>&quot;We've entered a period where the perceived 
      power of business has become overwhelming for many,&quot;</b> says Charles 
    Derber, professor of sociology at Boston College and author of <i>Corporation 
      Nation</i> (1998, St. Martins Press). &quot;Average citizens fear they 
    are losing control to a corporate ascendancy unmatched since the Gilded 
    Age of the 19th century.<b> We are on the brink of a powerful anti-corporate 
    backlash.&quot;</b>    
  <p style='margin-right:-27.0pt'><b>Anti-corporate sentiment and activism 
    now cut a swath across society</b>, and companies increasingly are <b>finding 
      themselves at the hands of public campaigns to reign in their perceived 
      excesses</b>. Republican Presidential hopeful Sen. John <b>McCain</b> (R, Ariz.) shook up the <b>GOP</b> last year with <b>his anti-corporate 
        platform of campaign finance reform</b> and attacks on corporate soft-money 
    donations. And in the final days of his Presidential campaign, <b>Al 
      Gore gained high ratings with his pledge to take on &quot;big tobacco, 
      big oil, big polluters.</b>&quot; He lost that race in part due to the <b>anti-corporate message of Ralph Nader.</b> &nbsp; 
  <p> <b>The growing suspicion that corporations have grown too large and 
    unaccountable does not bode well for companies that ignore its implications.</b> &quot;The public is predisposed to be critical of corporations and they 
    are <b>ready to believe negative assertions about big business</b>,&quot; 
    says longtime pollster and chairman of DYG Inc<b>. Daniel Yankelovich. 
      &quot;Executives haven't had to worry about social issues for a generation, 
      but there's a yellow light flashing now, and they'd better pay attention.&quot;</b> &nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>High-Profile Campaigns</b> &nbsp;</p>
        <p> Stakeholders are demanding -- often successfully -- that corporations 
          focus on goals beyond the bottom line. Activist groups have made headlines 
          recently by targeting individual corporations and groups that work for 
          their interests, such as the World Trade Organization. They use sophisticated 
          tactics, employ high-profile campaigns, and <b>are united by a centralizing 
            principle: Corporations have too much power.</b></p>
        <p>Recently, protesters descended on Kellogg Co. headquarters in Battle 
          Creek, Mich., demonstrating against the presence of genetically modified 
          organisms in the company's products. Kellogg executives also fielded 
          complaints from parents about the presence of Toucan Sam, the Froot 
          Loops mascot, in a line of children's books about counting. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>&quot;These are not wild radicals . . . . They are sophisticated 
          groups who can talk eyeball to eyeball with any CFO,&quot;</b> says 
          management consultant Allan A. Kennedy, author of <i>The End of Shareholder 
            Value</i> (2000, Perseus Press<b>). &quot;They understand the business 
              world and have an agenda.&quot;</b> Furthermore, groups are <b>becoming 
                more effective as they use the Internet to organize, to promote grievances, 
                and to spread the word.</b> &nbsp;</p>
        <p> In increasing numbers consumers are willing to use their purchasing 
          power to punish corporations with bad track records. A recent study 
          by the <b>Conference Board Inc.</b> revealed that close to 50% of all 
          consumers have refused to buy from companies they considered socially 
          irresponsible. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>Nike Inc.,</b> the global shoe retailer, learned a powerful lesson 
          about consumer backlash when activists successfully associated their 
          brand image with child labor and Third World labor violations. Pressure 
          from groups such as San Francisco-based Global Exchange was instrumental 
          in getting Nike to the negotiating table. The group used tactics such 
          as buying stock in Nike that allowed its members to crash shareholder 
          meetings. And it held press conferences that showcased an Indonesian 
          factory worker who was brought to the US to speak about Nike's sweatshop 
          working conditions abroad. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>Companies such as Nike and Monsanto learned that activists can 
          quickly reduce years of accumulated, positive brand equity through highly 
          publicized campaigns.</b> Nike eventually conceded to critics in 1998 
          when it announced that independent organizations would be allowed to 
          inspect the overseas factories that make the company's products, that 
          it would toughen the health and safety standards in the factories, and 
          that it would crack down on the use of child labor. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> Nike's director of global issues management Vada Manager admits <b>the 
          company suffered from &quot;arrogance&quot; </b>in the early days, but 
          has since <b>learned it can no longer operate beyond public scrutiny. </b>&quot;There were early warning signs . . . . We should have engaged 
          earlier with activist groups to better understand where they were coming 
          from,&quot; says Manager.</p>
        <p>More companies are following Nike's example, <b>realizing that the 
          best way to reduce public pressure is through dialogue, openness, and 
          accountability.</b> &quot;Now, we try to be respectful to organizations 
          that approach us,&quot; says Manager. &quot;We're active in organizations 
          such as the Fair Labor Assn., where we meet with labor groups and other 
          companies to design uniform rules and requirements for monitoring and 
          assessing our overseas factories.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
        <p> Nike implemented <b>Transparency 101,</b> a program that shares the 
          results of internal and external monitoring efforts at Nike factories 
          around the world. &quot;We needed a defense against investigations into 
          our factories from outside forces. It's a way <b>to preempt</b> non-governmental 
          organizations and the media from playing <b>'gotcha.'</b> For us, that 
          level of transparency was necessary and appropriate <b>to send the message 
            that we have nothing to hide.&quot;</b></p>
        <p> Even when the findings are unflattering, Nike says it is not afraid 
          to admit its problems. &quot;We have a huge supply chain. There's no 
          way in any given day that nothing is ever going to go wrong,&quot; says 
          Manager. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> In fact, a recent report paid for by Nike revealed that workers at 
          nine of the company's contract factories in Indonesia have witnessed 
          verbal and physical abuse of workers by supervisors, as well as sexual 
          harassment of female workers, the <i>New York Times</i> reported in 
          February. Global Exchange praised the company for releasing the findings, 
          and Nike has initiated a remediation plan. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>Campus Strategies</b> &nbsp;</p>
        <p> Another approach Nike has taken is to enlist colleges, whose students 
          have been some of its severest critics, to develop joint public-education 
          programs. Nike also commissions research with selected colleges on topics 
          related to the corporation's Third World operations. One research program, 
          called Rising Tides, explored wage rates in countries where Nike operates. 
          &nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>But the campus strategy has a more far-reaching goal than bridging 
          a generation gap. &quot;Companies live or die by customer loyalty,&quot; 
          says Manager</b>. &quot;We want our customers to embrace Nike for generations. 
          Because younger people are concerned about corporate accountability, 
          companies need to send the right message. If they don't, <b>they risk 
            an erosion of their customer base by not paying attention to these issues 
            early on.&quot;</b></p>
        <p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Experts agree that growing 
          anti-corporate sentiment will intensify.</span></b></p>
        <p> With continuing media coverage about alleged corporate wrongdoing, 
          from Bridgestone/Firestone tire recalls to lawsuits against tobacco 
          companies, <b>the willingness of the public to join the fray becomes 
            a growing threat to corporations across all industries.</b></p>
        <p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;The more consumers experience, 
          either directly or indirectly, corporate abuses or shortcomings, the 
          more willing they are to support increased regulatory actions,&quot; 
          says Yankelovich. &quot;From blackouts in California, to airline delays 
          because of labor disputes, or SUV accidents because of defective tires, <b>these all lend credibility to assertions that corporations are out 
            of control.&quot;</b></span></p>
        <p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Most activists claim they are 
          not &quot;anti-corporate&quot; and insist they are willing to work with 
          companies that are amenable to addressing their concerns. <b>&quot;We're 
            not anti-business</b> and we don't want an adversarial relationship 
          if it can be avoided,&quot; says Kevin Danaher, cofounder of Global 
          Exchange. &quot;Let's explore our differences and commonalties. Instead 
          of calling in lawyers and PR consultants, corporations should be willing 
          to talk to us.&quot;</span></p>
    <p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;We're not against 
          corporations per se</span></b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,&quot; 
            agrees Anuradha Mittal, co-director of the Institute for Food and Development 
            Policy, better known as Food First, a nonprofit think tank that has 
            challenged the agriculture industry over biotechnology. &quot;But we 
            want to make sure that there's a set of principles that are adhered 
            to, and we want some say in the creation of those principles.&quot;</span></p>
        <p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Despite this olive branch, <b>some business leaders take a hard line.</b> &quot;American business 
          holds higher ground than it's been willing to claim in recent years,&quot; 
          says Michael Baroody, executive vice president, policy, communications, 
          and public affairs, of the National Assn. of Manufacturers. <b>&quot;In 
            terms of the self-evident contribution business makes not just in the 
            economy but to the society, I think we need to be more aggressive in 
            claiming or reclaiming that higher ground of public opinion.&quot;</b> &nbsp;
          <o:p></o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p style='margin-right:-.25in'>It may be true that corporations need to 
          do a better job of showing the world they deserve credit, but <b>a &quot;no-compromise&quot; 
            stance will only hurt companies in the long run.</b> &quot;Today, consumers 
          want to take pride in companies they do business with,&quot; says Manager. <b>&quot;In this age, companies do not exist in a vacuum but have roots 
            that connect to other parts of a consumer's value system.&quot;</b></p>
        <p style='margin-right:-.25in'>Though large companies tend to be at the 
          most risk for intense public scrutiny, smaller firms also need to pay 
          attention to how this changing public landscape will affect them. &quot;Smaller 
          companies may not face activists, but they will feel the brunt of large 
          companies that are now pushing that pressure back onto them as suppliers,&quot; 
          says Peter Schwartz, author of <i>When Good Companies Do Bad Things</i> (1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons). Taking a proactive position by doing 
          a better job of communicating to the public both the financial and non-financial 
          aspects of their businesses is an important step smaller companies can 
          take to stem corporate backlash. Reaching out to local communities by 
          creating community advisory committees also can help create goodwill. 
          &nbsp;</p>
    <p> <b>Integrating good corporate citizenship as a core business strategy 
          also involves creating channels of communication to consumers.</b> Christine 
          Ervin, director of corporate communications for Kellogg, says that the 
          company was able to offset activist pressure by making it easy for customers 
          to contact the company and address their concerns. Kellogg monitors 
          its consumer 800 numbers and works closely with the Grocery Manufacturers 
          of America to address consumer concerns. &quot;We try to keep up to 
          date on the issues. A well-informed company is one of the best things 
          that a consumer can have at [his/her] disposal, and we think that we 
          are well-informed. &nbsp;</p>
    <p> <b>&quot;We don't necessarily agree with everything our critics say,
