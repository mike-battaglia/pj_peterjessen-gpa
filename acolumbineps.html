  <h2>Postscript 
    on the Columbine Tragedy  From Pessimism To Possibilities </h2>
  <h2> Solving the &quot;Rubik's&#153; Cube&quot; of Teenagers and Education</h2>
  <p>By Peter J. Jessen, © June 2000</p>
  <p class="tinytext">Includes Excerpts of <a href="communications.html" target="_blank"><strong>18 
    Conflict Resolution Models</strong></a> make up the Conflict Resolution 
    Models</p>
  <p>Whether one is a parent or child, educator or legislator, business man 
    or taxpayer, Columbine impacted on all. Will the contest of our post-Columbine 
    world represent the opening of the &quot;Mediation Door of Opportunity 
    for Positive Change&quot; or the hardening of attitudes and the opening 
    of the &quot;Doors of Dictated Change and Regional Withdrawal? &quot; 
    Will we insist on our positions, like the six blind men describing the 
    elephant, or will we seek common ground solutions for all? This Postscript 
    is provided as easy and necessary reading for adult and student alike, 
    as background preparation for implementing an all-stakeholder <b>school 
      mission marathon </b>in order to find answers to these questions<b>. </b>This 
    proposed marathon is approached from the perspective of <b>seven topics: </b>  </p>
  <p><b>1. Columbine<a name="Columbine"></a>: A Door Opening To or Closing 
    On Opportunity? </b></p>
  <p><b>Columbine</b>. April 20, 1999, tells us that in addition to the Ides 
    of March we have the Agonies of April, as Columbine shares its infamous 
    month in history with Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination, the Kent 
    State shootings, the last U. S. troops leaving Vietnam, the Oklahoma City 
    bombing, Columbine, and a 1st grader shooting another 1st grader a year 
    after Columbine. Most of these had one thing in common: young people involved 
    in violence and tragic deaths. </p>
  <p><b>Columbine</b>: 21 students wounded and a dozen students and one teacher 
    slaughtered by two fellow students who then slaughtered themselves. So 
    few, these two, yet they affected so many: individuals, families, communities, 
    states, nations, the world. How? By squandering the hopeful optimism regarding 
    the possibilities awaiting youth on the altar of self-imposed pessimism 
    and helplessness, closing not only themselves off to the possibilities 
    of the future, but also the possibilities and dreams of their fellow students 
    and the dreams of their teacher. These two youth had so much to live for 
    yet could not stand to live. These two youth had so much and yet enjoyed 
    it so little. These two students lived what many would call an enchanted 
    life, yet, instead, felt disenchanted. Columbine exposes us to the need 
    to find a better a way to deal with the modern marathon of K-12 education, 
    a marathon for kids, teachers, parents and tax payers/society as a whole. 
    And although it may be only a small fraction who won't run in the marathon, 
    their refusal to run, as evidenced by Columbine, can ruin the race for 
    a great many others. </p>
  <p><b>Teenagers and education</b> have become <b>like a rubics cube: </b>a 
    seemingly innocent piece of color and brightness, yet being representative 
    of intricate and many combinations of moves. How to get all in alignment? 
    Many try. Few succeed. And yet, in life, as with the rubics cube, any 
    action taken sets off a set of reactions or chain reactions, for each 
    spin of the horizontal or vertical squares influences all succeeding actions. 
    So too with teenagers and education. How can we solve the teenagers and 
    education puzzle, a puzzle that begins before kindergarten, a puzzle that 
    will require all the heads involved in its solution, a puzzle which is 
    but the first of a series of puzzles encountered in life by all? </p>
  <p><b>Many questions present themselves: </b>how can we better prepare our 
    kids and their adults (parents and teachers) to successfully run and complete 
    this K-12 educational marathon? What will be the future of education, 
    public and/or private, tax payer and/or voucher supported, neighborhood 
    school and/or school choice, local and/or state funding, individual efforts 
    and/or collaborative, whole language and/or phonics, direct instruction 
    and/or discovery learning, developmentally appropriate practices and/or 
    learning style customization? What is meant by education and how are its 
    institutions (from teachers colleges to government education departments 
    to school boards to the schools themselves to be evaluated? How do we 
    deal with those who want to radically change education and those who want 
    to leave it as is? How do we deal with a traditional system of set, unchanging 
    structures in a world that is rapidly changing? How do we deal with a 
    work force schooled before modern communications, the Internet, and globalization? 
    How do we deal with teenagers in terms of rapid change in the midst of 
    timeless truths and values that have not changed? </p>
  <p><b>And how do we answer the perennial questions</b> to which all seek 
    a resolution: <b
>how to fund </b>education and <b
>what to teach and how to teach it? </b>Finally, how do we answer the haunting 
    question of whether or not there can be &quot;safe&quot; schooling? And 
    on a broader level, we can ask &quot;From Columbine to Where? What next? 
    &quot;</p>
  <p>Our postscript on the tragedy of Columbine is to explore the situational 
    complex of modern education, from the macro (institutional, societal) 
    level to the micro (individual, self) level, and to propose a process 
    for enabling communities to use a method for running a positive marathon 
    of mediating the mission of their own school institutions, in order to 
    avoid hysterically pessimistic fatalism and instead to embrace historically 
    optimistic possibilities. . </p>
  <p><strong>2. Finding<a name="Finding"></a> the Right Questions for Resolution 
    Action: Marathon As a Metaphor for what is at stake regarding the Future 
    of our teenagers and the their K-12 schools</strong></p>
  <p>Columbine occurred three days after the final draft of <em>The Terry 
    Hitchcock Story: Heroes and Values</em> was completed. Like everyone else, 
    we were stunned. As we followed the story, we realized that we had missed 
    a significant application of the &quot;marathons of life&quot; theme. 
    Yes it applies to any individual, and yes it applies to the individual 
    students who have to run the K-12 marathon. But in reflecting upon Columbine 
    and all of the work we have done with corporations, from start-ups to 
    Fortune 500 companies, as well as our teaching at colleges and universities, 
    it dawned on us that the theme applies to institutions as well. </p>
  <p>This &quot;Postscript&quot; is being written on the first anniversary 
    of Columbine. <b
>A key question</b> that is asked is whether or not there is a mechanism or model 
    to follow which would enable all of those in society who have a stake 
    in education to work together to create a resolution acceptable to all? 
    The answer is yes. 18 are discussed in this paper [expanded for 5 and 
    then from 10]. These 18 models are presented for use in mediating conflict 
    resolution, <b>nine</b> which have been <b>used</b> <b
>at the macro level</b> <b>of society,</b> or nation to nation or institution 
    to institution (Masada in Palestine of the first century between the Romans 
    and Zealots; West Germany after World War II, South Africa to transition 
    from apartheid to post apartheid, and the &quot;Oslo Process&quot; of 
    the Middle East today between Israel and the Palestinian Authority). The 
    reader is asked to think of other macro models (and to alert the author 
    of them for future consideration), as well as any micro models which any 
    reader of this essay, whether adult or student, knows of and which can 
    be recommended for <b
>use</b> <b>at the micro level</b> of face-to-face level of human interaction 
    (<strong>nine</strong> are listed below). </p>
  <p>Overall violence among school kids is going down. Yet &quot;isolated 
    incidents&quot; show how isolated we are not. Nine incidents the year 
    before, with 15 killed and dozens wounded, impacting on thousands more. 
    With nearly that many at just one school, Columbine, it garnered far more 
    publicity. And then just over a year after Columbine,a first grade boy 
    shoots and kills a first grade girl with whom he had been arguing the 
    day before. </p>
  <p>The shooters at Columbine thought they could control life in death. Their 
    fellow students now have to find control of the meaning of their lives. 
    In the wake of these two, countless thousands of schools have clamped 
    down on students. Of the Columbine victims that survived, more than two 
    dozen are &quot;classified as homebound' for physical and psychological 
    reasons„, so they receive their education at home. &quot; Three are still 
    in wheel chairs, while &quot;many continue to seek therapy and religious 
    counseling? It has effected student studies and behavior, as &quot;academically, 
    a lack of an ability to concentrate, and the unpredictability of the students 
    in the classroom,&quot; where every two to three weeks &quot;they're off 
    the wall and extremely difficult to handle. &quot; What does this all 
    mean? According to the Columbine principal, Frank DeAngelis, &quot;It's 
    about not giving up, and that's what Columbine High School represents. 
    &quot; Thus, he says, &quot;It's been a year of hills and valleys; we're 
    learning to cope. &quot; And yet &quot;he, like his students, faculty, 
    and staff, is not about to give up. &quot; [&quot;Columbine: A Year of 
    Tragedy and Triumph,&quot; Mindy Sink, Upfront, a scholastic magazine 
    by The New York Times, April 10, 2000, pp. 8-10]</p>
  <p>How do they survive the shootings? How do they grieve and then get on 
    with life? How do they, or any school with a shooting, deal with the pain 
    and struggle, and survive? How do they survive the marathon of a year's 
    after shocks of emotions? </p>
  <p>Liberals and conservatives are both using the concept &quot;mediating 
    structures&quot; to &quot;empower people&quot;. We believe that this concept 
    of &quot;mediating structures&quot;, organizations and institutions that 
    stand between the larger society and the individual, provides a workable 
    alternative in which both liberals and conservatives can work through 
    such structures together to resolve these issues in a way their traditional 
    formulas won't. By turning &quot;the individual&quot; and &quot;nation-state&quot; 
    into war cries of the &quot;ideal,&quot; following an &quot;either/or&quot; 
    path rather than a &quot;both/and&quot; approach, the opportunity to bring 
    both sides to the table is missed. With &quot;both/and,&quot; the extremes 
    of the arguments for and against nationalizing formerly local institutions, 
    especially those of education, housing, the poor, and other social problems, 
    can be substituted for the task of finding common ground on which all 
    of those who are arguing can stand. </p>
  <p>This is not the place to discuss this approach in detail or the history 
    of its acceptance over the past 25 years of those from one end of the 
    political spectrum to the other, including its use by both the George 
    Bush White House and the Bill Clinton White House. To learn this history 
    and background, the reader is pointed toward the book <em>To Empower People: 
      From State to Civil Society</em>, 20th Anniversary Edition. </p>
  <p>We find ourselves standing with those who believe this notion of mediation 
    can provide the &quot;True North&quot; direction, be the North Star of 
    a bipartisan agenda that can provide practical solutions to previously 
    untractable problems by utilizing a method that minimizes the need to 
    begin first by defending one ideological position or another. This approach 
    is neither pro-government nor anti-government, but rather a non-ideological 
    alternative that allows all concerned positions a chance toward developing 
    an &quot;answer to what Aristotle said is <b>the</b> political question: 
    How ought we to order our lives together? &quot; (p. 153 of <em>To Empower 
      People: From State to Civil Society</em>). </p>
  <p>Such an approach allows all participants to reject the easy answer, the 
    sprint of dictation (whether from a legislative body or a Superintendent 
    of Schools or a Principal, which can result in fostering individual and 
    group withdrawal) and instead allows all to accept the harder yet more 
    practical approach, a marathon of a mediated discussion involving all 
    of the effected participants (&quot;stakeholders&quot; in the language 
    of public policy strategic planning). </p>
  <p>In his seminal essay on the &quot;culture&quot; of liberty. (pp. 407-415), 
    Peter L Berger raises the questions on everyone's mind, echoing Aristotle 
    above and all philosophers writing about how to achieve the common good: 
    how can we best answer the two basic questions every human society must 
    answer, <b>(1)</b> &quot;Who are we? &quot; and <b>(2)</b> &quot;How 
    are we to live together? &quot;In other words, he asks, how can we achieve 
    an answer to these fundamental questions, without which &quot;both social 
    philosophers and social scientists have long agreed that there can be 
    no order in human affairs without such a consensus&quot;? Carl Dahlstrom 
    has written that without a consensus, society will waver back and forth 
    between anarchy and despotism. What better time than now to develop such 
    a consensus, or common ground, particularly in terms of education? </p>
  <p>What needs to be mediated are the divergent views ranging from <b>(1)</b> those who view public education as the crucial institution to creating 
    a commonweal of citizens, to <b>(2)</b> those who believe they are merely 
    &quot;government schools&quot; pitting one group against another and undermining 
    the social fabric and the values on which the country was founded, to <b>(3)</b> those in between who are concerned but are also confused and 
    not sure what should be done. </p>
  <p>The phrase &quot;Case for a Tragic Optimism&quot; is taken from the 1984 
    essay in Victor Frankl's book, <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em><b> </b> (called &quot;one of the ten most influential books in America,&quot; 
    by a 1991 Library of Congress/Book-of-the-Month Club &quot;Survey of Lifetime 
    Readers&quot;). It helps us to understand the importance of running life's 
    personal and institutional marathons. Frankl's book describes what he 
    learned from his four year experience in German concentration camps during 
    World War II. The survivors ran a marathon we can only barely begin to 
    comprehend. Frankl's basic points are that life gains purpose in the search 
    for meaning and <strong>that each individual, in the final analysis, chooses 
      the attitude</strong> he or she will have in responding to any situation. </p>
  <p>Frankl's classic book is more than just a memoir of one man's experience. 
    It bears testimony to the experiences of others, a self-help book and 
    a psychology manual, as well as bearing testimony to the break down of 
    institutional conflict resolution. </p>
  <p>This education mediation marathon suggestion highlights the necessity 
    of a wide ranging dialogue between all the parties involved in education, 
    in order to more optimistically address the two fold tragedy represented 
    by Columbine: <b>(1)</b> youth killing youth and <b>(2)</b> the vast 
    array of stakeholders, albeit all well intended, being unable to resolve 
    basic issues because of starting from divergent, multiple realities, and 
    often swinging toward &quot;despotism&quot; which tends to promote more 
    student &quot;anarchy,&quot; etc. Keep in mind that our suggestion also 
    applies to any sector of society as well as to any society as a whole. </p>
  <p>Frankl's book and his postscript speak directly to the Columbine tragedy 
    in particular and to the whole question of what society might to do about 
    it in general. He concluded his postscript by affirming his &quot;tragic 
    optimism,&quot; because, despite the horrors that occur in the world, 
    we can still find meaning in our lives, survive, and prepare each generation 
    for the future. He asks us to be alert in a twofold sense: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. </p>
      <p>And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Of all the highly publicized school shootings, Columbine has captured 
    the imagination of society far greater than any other. As we look at the 
    bodies of dead students, we recognized that we too have to be alert in 
    another two-fold sense as well: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Since Columbine we know what some students are capable of. </p>
      <p>And since the responses to it, from all sides, we know what is at 
        stake. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In his essay, Frankl writes that &quot;a tragic optimism&quot; is maintaining 
    a sense of optimism despite the &quot;tragic triad&quot; of (1) pain, 
    (2) guilt, and (3) death. It means, in other words, to use the title of 
    another Frankl book: <b
> Saying yes to life in spite of everything</b>. This means that &quot;life is 
    potentially meaningful under any circumstances. &quot; If all the stakeholders 
    in education can get that point across to students (as well as live it 
    themselves), that life is meaningful, in a shared way, many of the problems 
    of education could be resolved in a way satisfactory to all stakeholders. </p>
  <p>In terms of the schools, what is their mission in our society? What method 
    should they use to peacefully and happily coexist and serve with the rest 
    of society's institutions<b
>? Only with the institutions of education interacting with the other institutions 
      of society can these questions and problems be adequately answered and 
      resolved. </b>This is why we propose, as a means to resolve the conflicts 
    and reduce if not eliminate future Columbines, an educational institution 
    conflict resolution mission and development method marathon, with the 
    runners being all of the involved individuals and institutions, to find, 
    to use Justice Felix Frankfurter's phrase, a &quot;binding tie of cohesive 
    sentiment. &quot; </p>

    Regarding the 16 models of conflict resolution<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    This continues my quest to both understand conflicts and to develop workable 
    resolutions for such conflicts, whether personal (micro) or between larger 
    aggregations of individuals in the institutions and nations of society 
    and the world (macro).&nbsp; I began the list with a total of 5 macro 
    in 1997, with the micro being added in 1999.&nbsp; As new ones are learned 
    of, they are added.&nbsp; <br>

    Peter Berger has coined, among many highly useful terms, this pair: <strong>&quot;historically 
      specific conservatives&quot;</strong> (those of the left or right who 
    would usher in their desired type of society and then freeze it in place) 
    and <strong>&#147;historically nonspecific conservatives&quot;</strong> (those who accept change and make haste slowly).&nbsp; I find them so 
    much more useful as a way of looking at the ideological landscape (as 
    it cannot be avoided).&nbsp; As I also state on those pages, this and 
    another pair of Berger&#146;s analytical word tools,<strong>&quot;calculus 
      of meaning&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;calculus of pain&quot;</strong>, 
    are, in my judgment, the critical one- two punch of analysis and conflict 
    resolution.&nbsp; They are t<strong>wo of the four key organizing principles</strong> for dealing with such conflict resolution, along with the concepts of <strong>&quot;lists/recipes&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;collaboration.&quot;</strong>&nbsp; 
    &quot;Recipes&quot; comes from Berger as well, through Alfred Schutz.&nbsp; 
    All of which I would make a part of what Cassidy call &#147;the politics 
    of love,&#148; which has to be both the umbrella over and foundation under 
    all discussions and interactions if true conflict resolution is to be 
    achieved in a way that love and justice pervades and is received and perceived 
    by both sides.&nbsp; These models are of particular importance and relevance 
    in the continuing conflicts in the world today, whether by nation-states 
    or independent groups dedicated to changing society through violence.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    THE 8 MACRO MODELS<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    FIRST<a name="FIRST"></a>:&nbsp; Masada, a &quot;how NOT to work things 
    out. It is a story set in Palestine/Israel of 72 A.D.&nbsp; It is a story 
    of the failure to attempt or trust mediation (although it is not known 
    if any was attempted).&nbsp; The Zealots, on top of the 1300 foot plateau, 
    were unable to prevent the Romans' slow, methodical, progress of building 
    a ramp to the top of the sheer cliff in order to breach their defenses 
    (FN#13).&nbsp; It is a lesson in both international and local politics 
    and an opportunity to understand our own behavior better.&nbsp; &quot;Masada&quot; 
    was a four part ABC Novel for Television, April 5-8, 1981.&nbsp; Having 
    people watch the video tape would be an excellent dynamic.&nbsp; CIS (Cultural 
    Information Service), in NYC, wrote a marvelous study guide for it, that 
    stands alone as a guide to any discussion regarding conflict resolution, 
    peace, etc., as well.&nbsp; It is 15 pages, with pictures, on 11x14 paper 
    (FN#14)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    SECOND<a name="SECOND"></a>:&nbsp; &quot;The Evangelical Academies&quot; 
    model of post World War II West Germany, where the mediator is the faith 
    community, discussed in the book Confession, Conflict &amp; Community.&nbsp; 
    They were established by the faith community.&nbsp; In a word, unlike 
    Humpty Dumpty and all the king's men, they&nbsp; were able to help put 
    West Germany back together again, as &quot;the academies played a singular 
    role in restoring the democratic idea after the disaster of the Third 
    Reich.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;The Evangelical Academies&quot; have been in 
    continuous use, and were central to the recreation of West Germany.&nbsp; 
    These &quot;academies&quot; provided a sense of dialogue between all the 
    parties, fostering and enabling a kind of &quot;mediating action&quot; 
    to take place between the social and political forces (not as in arbitration 
    or in seeking compromise, but rather in the sense of creating a &quot;zone 
    of freedom&quot; in which the concerns of all sides could be brought to 
    bear upon the urgent issues before them, using a set general process agendas 
    in which the specifics could be discussed and dealt with by all concerned.&nbsp; 
    The meetings were held outside the cities in the country side, with minimal 
    distractions, and always with a mixed group of stakeholders.&nbsp; The 
    first conference brought together &quot;150 lawyers and economists&quot; 
    and later ones &quot;laborers, farmers, physicians, and social service 
    workers--people from all walks of life.&quot;&nbsp; A key lesson learned 
    was the importance and &quot;necessity for each occupational group within 
    the framework of modern society to encounter the group that it most complained 
    about.&quot;&nbsp; (FN#6)</p>
  <p>The academies continued through the decades, with problems addressed 
    ranging from road locations to international issues of concern.&nbsp; 
    19 Academies continue today under an umbrella association, and is working 
    with similar movements in Africa, Asia and America.&nbsp; They were also 
    used in East Germany to give citizens a place to gather and discuss prior 
    to the fall of the Berlin Wall (prior to which over 1,500 conferences 
    were held each year), and then used later to help in the reunification 
    of West Germany and East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. (FN#7)&nbsp; 
    Why not regarding education in America?</p>
  <p>THIRD<a name="THIRD"></a>:&nbsp; the mediation model used in South Africa.&nbsp; 
    The model is outlined as a theoretical piece as well as being discussed 
    in the practical terms of its actual use in this setting.&nbsp; The 1989 
    book The Passing Summer : A South African's Response to White Fear, Black 
    Anger, and the Politics of Love, by Michael Cassidy, discusses the situational 
    complex of apartheid in the summer of 1986, including the several centuries 
    of actions that led to apartheid.&nbsp; The actual South Africa mediation 
    model is outlined in the 1988 book A Future South Africa:&nbsp; Visions, 
    Strategies, and Realities, edited by Peter L. Berger and Bobby Godsell 
    (FN#8). On page 320-321 of the Berger-Godsell book is the &quot;Analytic 
    Scheme&quot; for guiding the research and, on pp. 322-323, is Peter Berger's 
    outline for &quot;reality-testing&quot; what is being done.&nbsp; The 
    change in South Africa, as anywhere else, did not &quot;just&quot; happen.&nbsp; 
    The Berger-Godsell report was released in 1988, two years before Nelson 
    Mandella was released from prison, who was then elected President in 1994.&nbsp; 
    After 1988 and 1989, the contents of these two books merged in the conferences 
    that were held to discuss the transition out of apartheid.</p>
  <p>In an update received from Bobby Godsell in March 2000, he discusses 
    four additional conferences which were particularly helpful, conferences 
    which bear witness to how well this model can be used successfully all 
    along the spectrum of stakeholder positions.&nbsp; The four conferences 
    were:&nbsp; (1) 1989, called by the then new Afrikaner Nationalist president, 
    FW de Klerk to address the problems of political violence (which the African 
    National Conference boycotted); (2) 1994:&nbsp; called by a Kenyan Bishop 
    which resulted in involving the Inkatha Movement, led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 
    just weeks before the first democratic election in 1994, enabling it to 
    join the now cooperating ANC and de Klerk government; (3-4) the use of 
    the &quot;reality testing&quot; model of the referenced 1988 book by groups 
    on the far right and left:&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Broederbond, a secret Afrikaner 
    Nationalist intellectual organization, led during this critical period 
    by J P de Lange, and by the South African Communist Party.&nbsp; Of these 
    latter two, Bobby Godsell states, &quot;In both cases they concluded that 
    [their old] strategies were not possible,&quot; and thus they too joined 
    to work cooperatively with the other stakeholders regarding South Africa's 
    development&quot; (FN#11).&nbsp; And such mediation continues.&nbsp; Godsell 
    also reports (FN#9) that &quot;Evangelical Christianity continues to play 
    a surprising role in providing a common road to modernity for black and 
    white, left and right&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (FN#10).&nbsp; It is the &quot;common 
    road,&quot; properly given a &quot;realty testing,&quot; which provides 
    its users with a peaceful outcome as well as opportunity to move toward 
    a more just one. Perhaps the title of Michael Cassidy's book shows us 
    why it worked in South Africa and why it can work in education in the 
    United States:&nbsp; The Passing Summer : A South African's Response to 
    White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love.&nbsp; Fear and anger 
    clouded both the presentation of issues and judgment about them.&nbsp; 
    Love, in the form of the Golden Rule, was used.&nbsp; Love, however defined, 
    whether in terms of civility of discourse, civility in relational interaction, 
    or both, can enable the Archimedian lever of mediation to enable the resolution 
    of the problems to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.</p>
  <p>FOURTH<a name="FOURTH"></a>:&nbsp; The Oslo Accords Process being used 
    in the Middle East to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian 
    Authority was begun in the woods of Norway.&nbsp; See The New Yorker article, 
    Annals of Diplomacy section (Dec. 20, 1993, pp. 77-85):&nbsp; &quot;THE 
    PEACEMAKERS&quot;.&nbsp; Subhead:&nbsp; &quot;In Norway, two Israeli academics 
    [the initial mediators] worked for months to broker the secret peace--and 
    succeeded where governments had failed.&quot;&nbsp; The initial success 
    of what is being called &quot;The Oslo Accords&quot; has come about because 
    both sides agreed to leave the most contentious issues until last (West 
    bank, the final settlement of Jerusalem, and full sovereignty passed to 
    the Palestinian Authority, or &quot;PA&quot;, among others of the most 
    thorniest issues), so as to work on the areas on which there either was 
    agreement or clear room for negotiation.&nbsp; The theory:&nbsp; that 
    the process of working together would enable both sides to become familiar 
    with each other, break down the walls between them, and develop a kind 
    of trust that would enable them, after resolving the &quot;are negotiable&quot; 
    issues to finally tackle the major issues separating both sides, issues 
    which were originally labeled &quot;non-negotiable.&quot;&nbsp; Theory 
    problem:&nbsp;&nbsp; unlike with West Germany and South Africa, a common 
    faith bond between the two sides is missing.&nbsp; Rather than gradually 
    reconciling with each other (made possible by the use of love, the basis 
    of any faith community context), the process has been one sided, without 
    reconciliation because of the continued propaganda of hate and fanatic 
    Islamism, which has been the staple of the Palestinian culture since the 
    creation of the Jewish state in 1948, and the demand from certain Israeli 
    elements of a restoration of Israel as in Biblical times.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The irony is that the Masada roles are now reversed.&nbsp; The Palestinian 
    Authority is acting the role of Rome wanting the Israeli's to act the 
    role of the 1st century Zealots and kill themselves.&nbsp; In its current 
    state, this model is actually moving toward the Palestinian goal of a 
    Masada-like conclusion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To put it bluntly, the &quot;Oslo Accords&quot; need the &quot;politics 
    of love&quot; (Model #5 below) if the negotiators are to avoid the Masada 
    affect.&nbsp; The empirical reality is that the presence of the acknowledgement 
    of love in Models 2 and 3 were successful, and that its absence led to 
    the failure of #1 and is leading to the failure of #4.&nbsp; #5 organizes 
    this principle for any macro-level conflict negotiation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>FIFTH<a name="FIFTH"></a>, the mediation model based on Michael Cassidy's 
    &quot;The Politics of Love,&quot; in his book The Passing Summer : A South 
    African's Response to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Cassidy proposed this model for South Africa, with the urging that it 
    be incorporated in the country's constitution.&nbsp; As 78% of South Africans 
    (Black and White) professed to be Christians, the politics of love followed 
    their shared belief that &quot;God is love.&quot;&nbsp; The model served 
    as an inspiration to themselves regarding letting their better natures 
    prevail as continues to serve as in inspiration to other peoples of the 
    planet caught in the same kind of process.&nbsp; The model is also practical, 
    in that &quot;the golden rule is finally what life is all about&quot; 
    and is at the heart of every major world religion and most secular philosophies. 
    &nbsp;But how does a nation or large institution incorporate the golden 
    rule all claim to want to follow but find so difficult to follow?&nbsp; 
    Through love, which turns revenge into treating perpetrators of prejudice 
    with the respect and civility.&nbsp; Cassidy regarding meetings with the 
    head of detentions:&nbsp; &quot;I grasped afresh that South African blacks, 
    and especially black Christians, are in many ways incredible. Their capacity 
    to bear pain, to tolerate indignity, to dredge up new goodwill from who 
    knows where and still be gracious, never ceases to amaze me&quot; (p. 
    19).</p>
  <p>Cassidy discusses his ten point model in detail in his book's Part Six, 
    &quot;The Politics of Love (The outworking of love as a valid political 
    principle,&quot; in three chapters, Chapter 19 (&quot;Winning in the World's 
    Workshop&quot; based on the Swiss Hans-Ruedi Weber referring to South 
    Africa as &quot;the laboratory of the world,&quot; in 1973, for how they 
    did would greatly affect the world's belief in what is possible), Chapter 
    20 (&quot;Love as a Political Virtue&quot; which is to sing songs Cassidy 
    doesn't mention but which relate, the Dianne Warwick song &quot;What the 
    world needs now, is love, love, love&quot;, or the song made popular world-wide 
    by Michael Jackson and Pepsi Cola about the world needing love or Disney's 
    &quot;It&#146;s a Small, Small World After All&quot;), and Chapter 21 
    (&quot;Love in Structures&quot;, as in the constitution, etc.).</p>
  <p>The 10 point model proposed in 1988 by Cassidy, p. 425, which is needed 
    by those involved in The Oslo Accords and any other global &quot;hot spots&quot; 
    needing conflict resolution, is:&nbsp; <br>

  <p>In her book, The Human Condition, the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt says 
    we keep chaos at bay by keeping promises and that we deal with the irreversibility 
    of our words and deeds through forgiveness, that forgiveness and reconciliation 
    are not the provenance of Christians, although Jesus emphasizes it more 
    than anyone, but rather that both are necessary because of the &quot;human 
    condition.&quot;&nbsp; To forgive in order to be reconciled requires loving.&nbsp; 
    Love is what is missing in the Middle East with the Oslo Accords.&nbsp; 
    Without love, it will ultimately fail.&nbsp; Love and reconciliation are 
    a necessary part of the human condition.</p>
  <p>Macro models 2, 3 and 5 show love as a key ingredient for macro conflict 
    resolution.&nbsp; Models 1 and 4 suggest that its lack prevents resolution.&nbsp; 
    There is the evidence of another contemporary, long term, unresolved, 
    unreconciled, loveless conflict:&nbsp; Korea.&nbsp; The unsuccessful threatening 
    Cold War rhetoric of Washington has not worked.&nbsp; The recent summit 
    between North and South Korea was brought about by South Korea's Kim Dae 
    Jung, using a mix of Christian compassion and Confucian sincerity.&nbsp; 
    If this continues, this country could also be reconciled, using the &quot;politics 
    of love.&quot;</p>
  <p>SIXTH<a name="SIXTH"></a>, the 1975 Helsinki Accords, In terms of the 
    Helsinki Accords, I would juxtapose them with the Oslo Accords as well 
    as with Masada, both of which failed (interestingly enough, both failures 
    were in the Middle East), as I predicted in the items I'm sending to you, 
    as both Oslo and Masada were unable to either recognize and/deal with 
    hate and mistrust, and neither was able to view with love.&nbsp; According 
    to Natan Sharansky, the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords by the Soviet 
    tyrants was when they &quot;signed their own death warrant&quot;&nbsp; 
    (&quot;Why Weren't the Helsinki Standards Also Used for Oslo?&#148; Wall 
    Street Journal, May 14, 2001, p. A18).&nbsp; This &quot;third basket&quot; 
    meant the Soviets and their puppets were agreeing&nbsp; &quot;to uphold 
    the basic human rights of their own subjects&quot;, although they had 
    no intentions of doing so.&nbsp; But this was the &quot;Achilles' heel 
    of the totalitarian state&quot; as all actions were then scrutinized by 
    world opinion according to this agreement (that, plus going bankrupt trying 
    to keep up the arms race, while also intervening militarily in Vietnam 
    and Afghanistan).&nbsp; The &quot;Kremlin eventually buckled under the 
    strain,&quot; as, &quot;forced to relax their tyranny, they released a 
    spark of freedom that spread like a bush fire and burned down an empire&quot;, 
    a reminder from the East to the West that &quot;freedom has the power 
    to change the world.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharansky says the real lesson 
    lost by the Oslo accord folks was that the Soviet &quot;historic collapse 
    was shaped by the moral authority of dissidents&quot; in Russia and the 
    moral authority of certain political leaders in the U.S. willing to use 
    the phrase &quot;evil empire,&quot; which brought near apoplexy from the 
    left in this country. Sharansky&#146;s bottom line:&nbsp; &quot;the Oslo 
    accords failed to establish any connection between human rights and the 
    Israeli-Palestinian peace process.&quot;</p>
  <p>SEVENTH<a name="SEVENTH"></a>, the &#147;third track diplomacy&#148; 
    contributions and structures of the Roman Catholic Church, especially 
    in Mozambique, Central and South America, and South Korea.&nbsp; Berger 
    reminds us that the U.S. population as a whole is as religious as India 
    whereas the political and academic elites are as secular as Sweden.&nbsp; 
    This explains to me why they can't deal with morality, as it would be 
    a foot in the door for religion, and religion must be stamped out at every 
    point (see comment on Voltaire below).&nbsp; And religion, more than any 
    other, teaches morality and love.&nbsp; The recent (1999) book edited 
    by Peter Berger, The Desecularization of the World:&nbsp; Resurgent Religion 
    and World Politics, includes a piece by George Weigel, &quot;Roman Catholicism 
    in the Age of John Paul II.&quot;&nbsp; In it he discusses what John Paul 
    II has done as well as the &quot;third track diplomacy&quot; of the Rome-based 
    San' Egidio Community, which he says has played important roles in 3rd 
    track, &quot;most successfully in Mozambique.&quot;</p>
  <p>Another major difference is the lack of a concept of sin on the political 
    left, for if there is no sin, how can what one is doing be all that wrong?&nbsp; 
    The moral strength of Gandhi in India was not his but England's self image 
    as a moral nation, sinful though it may be, but one that didn&#146;t slaughter 
    people, and thus had to withdraw on those moral grounds (a concept totally 
    missing, of course in the Soviet Union and any past and present Marxist 
    states).&nbsp; Ditto in South Africa:&nbsp; it was the vision of people, 
    Black and White, both Christians, that enabled apartheid to be put back 
    in its box.&nbsp; The key now is to prevent its reverse.&nbsp; And the 
    civil rights movement in this country was also fought on a moral base.&nbsp; 
    Martin Luther King could not have been as effective as he was, nor the 
    supreme court able to rule as it did, if it wasn&#146;t for the moral 
    sense that counted, the moral sense of everyday Americans, who were revulsed 
    by such scenes as Bull Connor&#146;s dogs and the beating of unarmed, 
    peaceful marchers, not to mention the bombing of little girls and the 
    lynching of innocent men, and who said, &#147;but that is not us,&#148; 
    ushering in the change.&nbsp; What nation can survive without such a moral 
    base as it relates to its citizens and to its fellow nations?</p>
  <p>But even in moral nations, we need the &quot;politics of love&quot; (sin, 
    and all that, one must recall, aren&#146;t going away).&nbsp; Too many 
    seem to have Voltaire's wish.&nbsp; Weigel writes that Voltaire &quot;died 
    with the wish that the last king be strangled with the guts of the last 
    priest.&quot;&nbsp; For all of his defense to the death of one&#146;s 
    right to speak their opinion, &quot;the revolution he helped to inspire 
    defined its goal as little less than the overthrow of the civilization 
    the Church had helped nurture for centuries.&quot;&nbsp; When I was in 
    graduate school, those of my fellow grad students who were Marxists told 
    me I would be one of the first ones shot come the revolution (which they 
    sincerely believed would come).&nbsp; I said yes, but you'll be beside 
    me, as the first to go are the intellectuals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduate school 
    in the classroom with Berger was exciting, but with fellow grads disappointing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The left is so lacking in balanced morals (and the concept of &#147;moral 
    equivalency&#148; negates morals, making what is moral what one personally 
    &#147;feels&#148; to be moral, i.e., anything anyone does).&nbsp; But 
    how can you have a sense of morals that is all encompassing of all people 
    if you don't have a concept of sin and therefore believe any action of 
    one&#146;s own can&#146;t, by definition be wrong?&nbsp; If one thinks 
    it OK it is by definition OK, as seen by those who are &#147;historically 
    specific conservatives&#148; on both the left and right.</p>
  <p>EIGHTH<a name="EIGHTH"></a>, putting top representatives of conflicting 
    organizations in the anchoring environment of a Round Table, as was used 
    by King Author for his Knights of the Round Table, in order to get them 
    to act cooperatively together, and as was used by Katherine Graham<a name="Graham"></a>, 
    Publisher of The Washington Post, to foster open communications where 
    suspicioned communications existed before (just as its counter part, #8 
    in micro, is on an informal basis).</p>
  <p><b>THE 8 MICRO MODELS</b></p>
  <p>Those interested in education in any town or city, are urged to think 
    beyond the conflict resolution<a name="resolution"></a> process at the 
    institutional level (the 5 macro models above) and think also of the conflict 
    resolution process within their own minds between their &quot;better&quot; 
    and &quot;worse&quot; selves as well as between themselves and those they 
    must resolve conflicts with face to face, at home, at work, or at school 
    (the 5 micro models below).&nbsp; A recommended starting place is to consider 
    either the adoption of one of the following models or the development 
    of another model taking elements from any of the other models, whether 
    approached in terms of outcomes or in terms of personal procedures to 
    follow.&nbsp; These micro, face-to-face relationship models can enable 
    people to approach different tasks using the terminology of the field 
    of conflict resolution, enabling the kinds of effective inter-personal 
    relationships that will foster, support and sustain task completion.</p>
  <p>FIRST: a full spectrum model from lose-lose to win-win, to use as a guide 
    in how well you are doing in developing a win-win model, with the outcome 
    goal being that of collaboration, as seen on the following Chart of Win-Lose 
    Strategies for Task Completion/Relationship Building.</p>
  <p>LIST below of chart<a name="chart"></a> of the &quot;Win-Lose Spectrum 
    Regarding Strategies for Task Completion/Relationship Building</p>
  <p>Goal:&nbsp; Work diagonally toward collaboration to achieve tasks/goals 
    in a win-win manner</p>
  <p><img src="../images/winlosechart.jpg" alt="Chart" width="488" height="288"></p>
  <p>The previous chart was adapted by Peter Jessen from the model presented 
    by John Conhere who in tern presented his adaptation of the model of Ken 
    Thomas, in Conhere's &#147;Peer Mediation&#148; presentation, Fridley 
    Middle School, Fridley, MN, Jan. 19, 1993, and used by Peter Jessen in 
    his presentation of &#147;THE MOTIVATION ZONE:&nbsp; Heroes at Work with 
    Heroes in Training:&nbsp; Background, Rationale and &#145;Curriculum&#146; 
    For Parents &amp; Kids,&#148;&nbsp; before a meeting of the Wilson Cluster 
    Parent Connection Meeting, Wilson High School, Portland, OR, March 11, 
    1996, and before the Wilson High School Leadership Group in December 1998. </p>
  <p>Key to task success is to understand how to meld each stakeholder's and 
    stakeholder group's plans, agendas and &quot;to do lists&quot; into a 
    recipe which includes the concept of collaboration.&nbsp; Following Meichenbaum's 
    Facilitating Treatment Adherence:&nbsp; A [medical] Practitioner's Guidebook, 
    by Donald Meichenbaum and Dennis C. Turk;&nbsp; and Meichenbaum personal 
    statement to Peter Jessen) &quot;collaboration&quot; is further defined 
    as that which must be understood within the context that no collaboration 
    can take place unless everything is negotiable.&nbsp; &quot;Non-negotiable&quot; 
    means conflicts cannot be resolved and collaboration cannot be achieved.&nbsp; 
    Without collaboration on negotiable items, there can be no Win-Win.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Each group must drop its Wizard of Oz-ian curtains.</p>
  <p>Referring to Chart: Left to right = ascending degree of task completion.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom to top = ascending quality 
    of relationships.</p>
  <p>Avoidance (not face) = lose -&nbsp; lose.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Accommodates (giving in) = lose - win, as high level of task completion 
    is sacrificed for the sense of relationship.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Controller = win-lose is at the other end of the spectrum is the (where 
    high task completions are obtained by sacrificing relationships).&nbsp; 
    And although compromise has some value, its half win, half lose (not very 
    satisfying to either).</p>
  <p>Collaboration is the one that is highest in both relationship building 
    and task completion.&nbsp; Collaboration is the only one which is win-win 
    and the best for long-term win-win.&nbsp; BUT, collaboration only works 
    with that which is negotiable.&nbsp; Caveat:&nbsp; &quot;consensus trumps 
    collaboration&quot; (&quot;consensus leadership&quot; allows one or two 
    stop the rest in their tracks).</p>
  <p>SECOND: a win<a name="win"></a>-lose matrix model for fostering the developing 
    a win-win model of development of the young by their elders (parents and 
    teachers).</p>
  <p>This model was adapted from Mary Pipher, Rescuing Ophelia:&nbsp; Saving 
    the Selves of Adolescent Girls, p. 83, by Peter Jessen, and used in his 
    November 12, 1996 presentation before the Wilson Cluster Parent Connection:&nbsp; 
    &quot;From the 'Reviving of Ophelia' to 'The Shelter of Each Other':&nbsp; 
    The Questions, Answers, and Tools Mary Pipher Offers For Use in 'Saving 
    the Selves of Adolescent Girls' and in 'Rebuilding our Families' and Communities 
    into 'Tiospayes'.&quot; </p>
  <p>This matrix outlines the outcomes that result with any of the four control 
    strategies implemented by adults over their young, whether at home or 
    at school.&nbsp; The favored outcome is a strategy which includes high 
    affection and acceptance by the adults, meaning, in a word, love.&nbsp; 
    This one is favored because the outcome is an independent, socially responsible, 
    and confident young man or woman. </p>
  <p>Indeed, Part III of her book The Shelter of Each Other is entitled:&nbsp; 
    &quot;Solutions:&nbsp; What will survive of us is love.&quot;&nbsp; In 
    this she is in agreement with Cassidy (Macro model #3).&nbsp; The following 
    matrix responds to Mary Pipher's question:&nbsp; &quot;Under what conditions 
    will young men and women flower and grow?&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    THIRD:&nbsp; a set<a name="set"></a> of personal self-talk or internal-dialogues, 
    with the outcome goal being that of developing a sense of learned optimism, 
    not learned helplessness, so as to raise one's Adversity Quotient, for 
    the higher the AQ the easier and more successful one will be in overcoming 
    adversity.&nbsp; The clue concept is that of self-talk, of which there 
    are several models, which are discussed in Appendix C.&nbsp; All of them 
    can be subsumed under Paul Stoltz's concept with the book title of the 
    same name:&nbsp; Adversity Quotient:&nbsp; Turning Obstacles into Opportunities.&nbsp; 
    Stoltz notes that the American Psychological Association considers the 
    &quot;learned helplessness&quot; concept of Martin E.P. Seligman, as &quot;the 
    Landmark Theory of the Century.&quot;&nbsp; It explains why people give 
    up or stop short when faced with life's challenges.&nbsp; This theory 
    suggests that the shooters at Columbine felt helpless.&nbsp; The concept 
    &quot;Learned Helplessness&quot; is the personal thought process of &quot;simply 
    internalizing the belief that what you do does not matter.&quot;&nbsp; 
    The old wisdom statement is &quot;As a man thinketh.&quot;&nbsp; Stoltz 
    has created two ways of using self-talk (again, see Appendix C) to be 
    positive, optimistic, and tackle any challenge. &nbsp;These two are CO2RE 
    and LEAD.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To Stoltz, adversity is like a mountain to climb (a &quot;vertical&quot; 
    version of the &quot;horizontal&quot; version of running a marathon).&nbsp; 
    Three types attempt the climb:&nbsp; quitters, who either don't start 
    or who quit soon after starting; campers, who climb for a while and then 
    pitch their tents hoping for conditions to change that they prefer, and 
    just keep waiting, and climbers, who continue, no matter what, to the 
    top.&nbsp; Stoltz's goal for us:&nbsp; to each develop and nurture as 
    high an AQ behavior as possible, to grow a high AQ culture in every organization 
    or group in which one participates, and to thereby each is emailed tpunleash 
    each of our full potential.&nbsp; The key question (p. 281):&nbsp; &quot;How 
    important is it for you to strengthen your AQ and your ability to climb 
    through adversity?&quot;&nbsp; Like Stoltz, we all want to achieve Seligman's 
    &quot;Learned optimism&quot; as a way to change beliefs such that one 
    can see that it does matter what they try, and that they also matter.&nbsp; 
    Stoltz has three key terms:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; CO2RE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    LEADing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Vision<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Learn CO2RE (p. 115) and LEADing (p. 154) to create a climbing culture, 
    and develop the Vision (pp. 284-5) needed to sustain it.&nbsp; Teaching 
    AQ to others gives them a great gift:&nbsp; the ability to confront challenge 
    after challenge <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    C = Control:&nbsp; focus on what you can control, not what you cannot 
    control<br>
    O2 = Origin and Ownership (how did it start; what is your part of the 
    solution)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    R = Reach (goal:&nbsp; don't allow catastrophising to spill over into 
    other areas)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    E = Endurance (to reduce how long the adversity will last)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    L = Listen to your adversity response:&nbsp; high or low?<br>
    E = Explore all origins and your own ownership of the result<br>
    A = Analyze the evidence (regarding whether you have no control, regarding 
    if it really must <br>
    reach other areas, and regarding whether it really has to last a long 
    time)<br>
    D = Do something!&nbsp; (act).<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    p. 155:&nbsp; &quot;The LEAD sequence is based on the notion that anyone 
    can alter their success by changing their habits of thought.&nbsp; Change 
    is created by disputing old patterns and consciously forming new ones.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Proverbs 29:18:&nbsp; &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Stoltz says that to overcome adversity in a sustained way, one must first 
    dream the dream, then make the dream into a vision, and then sustain the 
    vision, hold on to it, and not let it go.&nbsp; P. 287:&nbsp; &quot;AQ 
    is not a quick fix, but rather an enduring formula built on a fundamental 
    truth that life is hard--but how you handle it determines your destiny.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Recall the discussion above of Frankl:&nbsp; even though life is filled 
    with suffering, guilt, and death, individuals can still derive meaning 
    from their pain and suffering.&nbsp; Because of vision, people know the 
    joy of &quot;life is beautiful:&nbsp; &quot;As long as one is alive, they 
    can ascend.&quot;</p>
  <p>FOURTH:&nbsp; the model<a name="model"></a> &quot;Managing Conflict for 
    Individual &amp; Team Success At Home and At School,&quot; presented to 
    the Wilson Cluster Parent Connection, May 13, 1997, by Sam Imperati, Executive 
    Director for The Institute for Conflict Management, Inc., and JoAnn Hjouck, 
    Mediator, Solomon's Tree.&nbsp; This model begins with the reality that 
    &quot;conflict arises in all relationships,&quot; that conflict arises 
    when someone insists they are right and you are wrong, and that the goal 
    is to avoid the &quot;standard&quot; model, stated tongue in cheek, of 
    &quot;I'll listen to your unreasonable demands if you'll consider my unacceptable 
    offer,&quot; and that to succeed in conflict resolution, even between 
    two people, those involved must act as a team even when they come from 
    different places/organizations/families/schools, etc.&nbsp; And although 
    not a replacement for the traditional legal process, it can compliment 
    it by providing a creative, economical and effective alternative to expensive 
    law suits.&nbsp; This means that those in conflict but build relationships, 
    not a case, and that they must understand that they are to fix a problem 
    not fix blame.&nbsp; This model has four steps:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1.&nbsp; Identify the problem by getting both sides to understand 
      what the other's position(s) and argument(s) is/are and to recognize 
      that they can solve the problem.</p>
    <p> 2.&nbsp; Explore the problem by looking at the underlying values, 
      needs, and interests of each party, identifying what each has in common, 
      and then exploring the best case-worst case scenarios regarding the 
      consequences of not reaching a resolution.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> 3.&nbsp; Develop solutions by listing all possible solutions, and 
      then exploring the options in terms of which solutions satisfy common 
      interests (O.P.T.I.O.N.S.:&nbsp; only proposals that include others' 
      needs succeed).&nbsp;</p>
    <p> 4.&nbsp; Select and implement a solution by negotiating a winning 
      solution that will generate full support now and in the future, and 
      not ending without laying out procedures to follow if what is worked 
      out worsens or, for whatever reason, the agreement reached is not working.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>FIFTH:&nbsp; the Lists<a name="Lists"></a>/Recipes for empowering both 
    sides to achieve success model, compiled by Peter J. Jessen.&nbsp; As 
    human beings have no instincts for social interaction (Berger's phrase), 
    they &quot;create instinct substitutes&quot; (Gehlen's phrase).&nbsp; 
    They create habits.&nbsp; These habits are said to follow the recipes 
    needed for success.&nbsp; People seek &quot;recipe knowledge&quot; (Schutz's 
    phrase).</p>
  <p>It derives from three concepts:&nbsp; (1) the social fact that humans 
    have no instincts for human interaction nor for keeping track of things, 
    and that to survive, must create &quot;instinct substitutes,&quot; which 
    are call roles.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every situation in which any person finds 
    themselves, is a stage, and each stage has its own called for role playing, 
    behavior, costume, etc.&nbsp; No one can live a role free existence.&nbsp; 
    (2), because of this, anyone can, individually and collectively, be a 
    playwright and participate in creating the stages on which they play, 
    and the plays in which they play their roles.&nbsp; (3), individuals&nbsp; 
    are capable of not only living in multiple realities AND are capable of 
    emigrating freely back and forth between them.&nbsp; Nothing, therefore, 
    is inevitable.&nbsp; All can be negotiated, worked out (except in those 
    cases where individuals or groups choose not to.&nbsp; This also means 
    that role playing is more important than one's feelings, that no matter 
    how one feels, the old theatre adage that &quot;the show must go on&quot; 
    is far more prevalent as a reflection of the realities of life than &quot;when 
    I get energized and feel great&quot; I will get going.&nbsp; This must 
    be the attitude of any who would overcome adversity and anyone who would 
    engage in the &quot;school mission marathon&quot; to answer the questions 
    before us, let along the attitude that must be in the heads of both students 
    and teachers/administrators, if all of them are to get the most out of 
    the K-12 educational experience marathon.&nbsp; Lists/recipes for action 
    are key to organizing the thoughts and actions one needs to achieve goals.&nbsp; 
    Some of lists include those of Stephen Covey's &quot;7 Habits Habits of 
    Highly Effective People and Families,&quot; Benjamin Franklin's list of 
    13 areas for achieving personal and professional success, the list of 
    Dale Carnegie's success principles, the list of success principles of 
    Napoleon Hill and W. Clement Stone, 6 lists for goal setting by Zig Ziglar, 
    Tony Robbins, Robert Schuller, Peter Daniels, Paul Stoltz, and Napoleon 
    Hill, as well as a list of books of lists by Sam Deep and Lyle Sussman.</p>
  <p>SIXTH:&nbsp; the Love<a name="Love"></a> each other model, as admonished 
    by Jesus, the Buddha, and Mohammed.&nbsp; Hannah Arendt says the human 
    condition requires forgiving others, as words and deeds are irreversible, 
    and keeping promises, as that keeps chaos at bay.&nbsp; Christians celebrate 
    the Jewish Passover as Maundy Thursday (Maundy having roots from three 
    languages:&nbsp;&nbsp; derived from mandatum, Latin, &quot;commandment&quot;; 
    also derived from the English, &quot;Mandate&quot;; and derived from the 
    French, &quot;Mande,&quot; meaning &quot;command&quot; or &quot;mandate&quot;).&nbsp; 
    For some, it refers to Jesus foot washing of his disciples and His command 
    to serve one another.&nbsp; To others it refers to his command to love 
    one another (both of which are common to all peoples of the Book:&nbsp; 
    Christians, Jews, Moslems).&nbsp; To me it refers to and includes both.&nbsp; 
    Or, as the liturgy at http://www.rockies.net/~spirit/sermons/s-maundy-thursday.html 
    states it:</p>
  <p>MAUNDY is an English form of the Latin word for commandment. The overarching 
    theme of Maundy Thursday is Jesus' new commandment, given on this the 
    eve of his death, to &quot;love one another even as I have loved you&quot; 
    (John 13:34) Maundy Thursday is the night of the final meal that Jesus 
    had with his disciples. The night in which he washed his disciples feet, 
    saying after he had done so: (John 13:12-17) &quot;Do you understand what 
    I have done for you? You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, 
    for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed 
    your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an 
    example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, 
    no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than 
    the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed 
    if you do them.</p>
  <p>What makes the events of 9/11/01 so mystifying for many, is that all 
    three religions who share and are all three called &#147;The Peoples of 
    The Book,&#148; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, have members with different 
    interpretations and who thus have adopted roles not of loving and serving 
    but of hating and killing.</p>
  <p>SEVENTH:&nbsp; the &#147;Serve<a name="Serve"></a> others model&#148;, 
    as admonished by Jesus, the Buddha, and Mohammed.&nbsp; Albert Schweitzer 
    said:&nbsp; &#147;I don&#146; know what you will do in life, but I do 
    know you won&#146;t be happy until you learn to serve others.&#148;</p>
  <p>EIGHTH:&nbsp; putting<a name="putting"></a> top individuals of conflicting 
    organizations in the anchoring environment of a Round Table, as was used 
    by King Author for his Knights of the Round Table, in order to get them 
    to act cooperatively together, and as was used by Katherine Graham, Publisher 
    of The Washington Post, to foster open communications where suspicioned 
    communications existed before. (just as its counter part, in macro, is 
    on a formal basis).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An excellent source of &quot;lists/recipes&quot; is any program based 
    on &#147;six sigma&#148;, the concept behind the concept of TQM (total 
    quality management), which is to minimize errors and, thus, defects.&nbsp; 
    Although designed for organizations as a whole, it also designed for use 
    individually, and can be used by such disparate organizations as manufacturing 
    plants and public schools.</p>
  <p>A &#147;P.S.&#148; to these 8 macro and 8 micro models for conflict resolution</p>
  <p>Note that the 2 KEYS to all of these 16 models is their organization.&nbsp; 
    It is recommended that their organizational principle be that of (1) &nbsp;L-I-S-T-S/R-E-C-I-P-E-S) 
    (as part of goals, plans, contingencies, time lines), and (2) c-o-l-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-I-o-n 
    (with all as negotiable).</p>
  <p>As Berger further points out, social scientists talk about the reality 
    that &quot;every society has its own corpus of officially accredited wisdom, 
    the beliefs and values that most people take for granted as self-evidently 
    true.&quot;&nbsp; In terms of education, there are multiple realities 
    involved, each viewing education differently, from the unique position 
    of its own prism of reality.&nbsp; This was not the case &quot;in the 
    old days&quot;, when, as Berger writes:&nbsp; &quot;Every human society 
    has institutions and functionaries whose task it is to represent this 
    putative truth, to transmit it to each new generation, to engage in rituals 
    that reaffirm it, and sometimes to deal (at least in words) with those 
    who are benighted or wicked enough to deny it.&quot;&nbsp; This used to 
    be an easy task when there was a dominant set of beliefs and values that 
    everyone took for granted.&nbsp; But modern society is pluralistic, with 
    multiple realities or worldviews that change, hence the saying of W.R. 
    Inage, that &quot;he who would marry the spirit of the age soon becomes 
    a widower.&quot;</p>
  <p>There are two other organizing principles which recommend for consideration 
    by both the macro models and the micro models, both suggested by Peter 
    Berger.&nbsp; The first is a &quot;calculus of meaning&quot; and a &quot;calculus 
    of pain,&quot; from his book Pyramids of Sacrifice:&nbsp; Political Ethics 
    and Social Change, in which he suggests that policies should be those 
    which provide the most meaning and the least pain, and that each calculus 
    include a list of outcomes that are not desirable, in order to avoid the 
    mistake of believing because the intent is pure, so will be the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Secondly, adapting from another analytical framework of Peter Berger, 
    it is recommended that each of the stakeholders in the discussions that 
    ensue review whether or not they are arguing from an ideological position 
    or not, whether they are actually flexible with their thinking, and to 
    ascertain whether or not they are being &quot;historically specific conservatives&quot; 
    or &quot;historically non-specific conservatives.&quot;</p>
  <p>This eliminates the argument over content labels (liberal vs. conservative, 
    Democrat vs. Republican), and instead focuses on the process.&nbsp; In 
    this way, it can be state that both the radical left and the radical right 
    are, hopelessly and romantically, historically specific conservatives.&nbsp; 
    The radical left looks forward to a future putative utopia which, when 
    reached, is to be frozen in place, never to change, because utopia has 
    been achieved.&nbsp; The radical right looks backward to a putative golden 
    age which it wishes to resurrect, after which it too is to be frozen in 
    place, as the golden age has been retrieved.&nbsp; The historically NON-specific 
    conservative recognizes yet resists the impulse to fine a &quot;good place&quot; 
    and to then rest and keep it that way, but also recognizes that it is 
    better to make haste slowly, and that as most historical actions have 
    unintended consequences, one needs to be slow in assuming that a proposed 
    policy or action is the solution.&nbsp; The Spanish Civil War, which, 
    like all wars, was a conflict &quot;full of moral ambiguities, with unspeakable 
    brutality on both sides,&quot; in which a monument has been erected to 
    the million who died, a monument placed inside a mountain not far from 
    &quot;The Valley of the Fallen&quot;.&nbsp; Berger's chilling words about 
    this should give us all pause and inspire us to be &quot;historically 
    non-specific conservatives&quot;:&nbsp; &nbsp;And the Spain that is now 
    emerging has nothing to do with what either side fought and died for. 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Or, as Cassidy put it in his book, &quot;Apartheid and all 
    its works will pass away.&nbsp; So will every answer which replaces it, 
    whether better and nobler or yet more sinful and worse.&quot;</p>

  <p><b>4. The Central<a name="Central"></a> Role of Education in Life's/Society's 
    K-12 Marathon in general and in the &quot;Ladder of Social Mobility&quot; 
    in particular. </b></p>
  <p>The &quot;battle&quot; over education is fierce because it is, in a real 
    sense, a battle over everything. The sociologist Peter L. Berger has outlined 
    why education is the key mechanism of the ladder of upward social mobility, 
    in that it is available to everyone in a way other mechanisms are not, 
    such as working hard at a trade (something often denied people because 
    of gender, race, or other consideration), marriage (usually more open 
    to women as a source of mobility), or through political connections or 
    pressure. A 5th mechanism is that of one's &quot;impression,&quot; what 
    Goffman calls &quot;impression management,&quot; meaning making an impression 
    on those who have already made it up the ladder higher than one has themselves, 
    enabling one to be accepted on a higher rung of the social ladder (a skill 
    that determines how well one uses the other four mechanisms). </p>
  <p>But it is education that is, theoretically, available to everyone (that 
    is, to anyone who has learned to read). As Berger points out, education 
    has become the most important mechanism for mobility, which is probably 
    why everyone has an idea on how to either improve it or why it should 
    be denied it to certain groups of the population one does not want to 
    see climb, the three biggest examples in our history being <b>(1)</b> the forbidding of teaching slaves to read, and then, after the Civil War, 
    preventing them from voting in the South by making being able to read 
    a requirement for voting, even though there were white share croppers 
    who also could not read, but who were allowed to vote, and <b>(2)</b> the forbidding of women to teach, own property, have influence of their 
    kids, etc (the biographies of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony 
    are source material enough, and <b>(3)</b> the making of children to 
    work long hours in factories, mines, and sweat shops. It is because of 
    the importance of education to one's ability to achieve social mobility 
    that has made, understandably, the educational system the main target 
    for political pressure on the parts of Blacks and other minorities (real 
    and self-proclaimed) trying to improve their chances in society. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>As social scientists are quick to point out, the only 
    animals that make plans, undertake projects, and dream about the future, 
    whether itôs the child imagining what it is like to be an adult or an 
    adult imagining what it would be like to be whatever they are dreaming 
    of. As the individual works this out in his or her mind, he or she does 
    it with the &quot;stereo&quot; view of their own biography as well as 
    their view of society as a whole. Historically, people saw dreams as just 
    that, dreams. Modern individuals see them as achievable. They see education 
    as the big difference in advancement in employment, politics, and learning 
    how to present themselves so that they will be accepted in the circles 
    they seek to enter. Today, people who want to achieve their dreams commit 
    themselves to running whatever learning marathon that is appropriate for 
    their particular dream. In sustaining their dreams they act, and in acting 
    they become the heroes of their own lives, and become like other ordinary 
    people who have done extraordinary things, which is as good a definition 
    of the hero acting on his or dream as you can find. </p>
  <p>Historically, people had ascribed status: status assigned them at birth, 
    so that if they were born into the upper or privileged class, they stayed 
    there, and if they were born into the poorer classes they stayed there 
    as well. The modern child grows up knowing that regardless of his or her 
    station at birth, it is possible to achieve one's dreams <b>if</b> one 
    learns how, which means, get a good education (although studies show that 
    the more affluent one's parents the greater the chance of acquiring a 
    higher education). </p>
  <p>Many self-improvement books continually repeat as almost a mantra: <b>leaders 
    are readers</b>, which is also the <b>key to good writing. </b>Skills 
    in both are acquired through the educational process. When General Douglas 
    MacArthur was asked what the most important skill of a soldier was he 
    answered &quot;being able to write. &quot; Biographers note that General 
    Dwight D. Eisenhower's advancement came because he was able to write clear 
    reports from wherever in the world he was sent. Biographers have likewise 
    noted the sense that a key reason for promoting General Ulysses S. Grant 
    was his ability to write (and his commander in chief, Abraham Lincoln 
    is considered by his biographers the best writer to hold the office of 
    President). All of these individuals read. And what is the key skill needed 
    in any profession? The ability to present oneself in writing, in speaking, 
    and in person (ladder of mobility steps #4 and #5: education and presentation 
    of self). Napoleon insisted on clear writing. Outside his tent sat his 
    Army's idiot. Any orders written for his Generals had to be shown to him 
    first. If he didn't understand it the orders had to be re-written. General 
    George Patton was not like the tall, deep voiced actor George C. Scott 
    who played him in the movie. He was short, very slender, and had a high 
    pitched voice. But he was a reader. He could write. And the depth of his 
    education enabled him to lead as few others have. </p>
  <p>At the bottom of all of this is education, whether it is Abraham Lincoln 
    learning by reading by the fire place or public schools being made available 
    to everyone or citizens with special views establishing private schools 
    or generals being sent to the elite school of West Point. Education was 
    and is the key. The GI Bill enabled thousands to get a college education 
    after World War II, just as the great need opened up. An even greater 
    need exists for the 21st Century to have students educated in the technological, 
    and the academic, in order to meet society's needs for 21st Century workers 
    for the Information/Internet/Bio-tech century. </p>
  <p>Regardless of what one thinks of public education as an institution, 
    education as a process is central to survival in the 21st century, both 
    professionally and personally. It is also the key to social mobility in 
    modern society. This is why education is too important to be left solely 
    to educators or to those who fund education. A society wide discussion 
    of stakeholders following one or more of the above models will enable 
    us to keep this most precious and valuable foundation of society the benefit 
    all sides of the debate want it to be. </p>
  <p><b
>5. Re<a name="Re"></a>-Enchanting the Iron Cage of Modernity</b></p>
  <p><b
>RE-LIGHTING THE ENLIGHTENMENT</b></p>
  <p >The classical sociologist Max Weber coined the term <b>&quot;The Iron 
    Cage,&quot;</b> his name for the routinized existence of modern times, 
    a condition of necessity to deal in an orderly way with huge numbers of 
    people and complicated technological equipment. He lamented the loss of 
    enchantment in the world, and called for a re-enchantment of the modern 
    world. Before modern times, most enchantment came through religion. The 
    schools, forced to work on an almost totally secularized basis have no 
    access to this avenue of enchantment, and the lack of funding has shut 
    down many of the secular forms of enchantment, such as drama, music, physical 
    education, and other electives. </p>
  <p ><b>Enchantment</b> used to come through myth and religion. Enchantment 
    became another casualty of the appalling slaughter and atrocities of World 
    War I, which had another consequence parents have been fighting with ever 
    since, and that is the swing from &quot;follow the rules&quot; to &quot;let 
    it all hang out. &quot; The fundamentalism in both Christianity and Islam 
    are not &quot;traditional&quot; or from &quot;the old days,&quot; but 
    are modern reactions to the loss of enchantment. The Star Wars films' 
    hold on the imagination of the young of two generations speaks to this 
    need for myths: &quot;let the Force be with you. &quot; Myths used to 
    deal with timeless truths, where logic dealt with pragmatic realities. 
    In her The Battle for God, Karen Armstrong shows how modern fundamentalism, 
    whether it be that of Pat Robertson or the Ayatollah Khomeini, is very 
    modern, in that it is a rationalist (modern) attempt to reassert myth 
    (timeless truths and values). The trap for modern fundamentalists is that 
    they are modern: in the past no one argued whether or not the monsters 
    and descents into the underworld were literal or not, as the attempts 
    of Fundamentalists to &quot;prove&quot; the truth of their Holy writ devalues 
    both religion and science. </p>
  <p ><b>The terrible and tragic consequence</b> of not having activities 
    that enchant, such as a wide range of electives, art, PE, etc. , is that 
    too often, in their search for enchantment, students seek enchantment 
    in chemicals, violence fantasies, guns,or other forms of unacceptable 
    behavior. </p>
  <p >The arts, including music and drama. P. E. and all the rest, are needed 
    not only to help give students a complete education, but also to enable 
    them to mentally and emotionally attack the core academic courses refreshed, 
    with a sense of knowing that after all of the hard work of repetitive 
    studies, they have a place to go to re-enchant themselves and to make 
    them happy to be there. <b>It is not either/or but both/and. </b></p>
  <p >Nonetheless, let us recognize that in a the real world of property 
    tax limitations and the ongoing search to both find stable sources of 
    funding and to settle the debate of what, finally constitutes the complete 
    educational program, curricular and extra-curricular, that all need to 
    help as much as possible. <b>The proposed mediated discussion involving 
      all concerned stakeholders </b>will enable communities, states, and the 
    nation to find common ground for all concerned. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p ><b>Robert Landauer,</b> in the Oregonian (September 1, 1998), has essentially 
    contributed a wonder full summary of the problems raised by this discussion, 
    in his article title and subhead: </p>
  <p  style='tab-stops:.5in'> <b>Consider the fourth &quot;R&quot;</b></p>
  <p  :27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt;tab-stops:
right .25in 1.5in'> </p>
  <p  style='tab-stops:1.0in'> <b>Evidence mounts that the arts aid student 
    achievement, </b></p>
  <p  style='tab-stops:1.0in'><b> should be in schools' center ring, not 
    just sideshow&quot;. </b></p>
  <p  :27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt;tab-stops:
right .25in 1.5in'> </p>
  <p >&quot;The 4th 'R'&quot;, the arts, refers to the fine and performing 
    arts. As Landauer points out, students involved in the various fine and 
    performing arts<b> do better in school</b> than those that don't. Indeed, 
    they do better on the SAT's. This is right brain and left brain synergy 
    at its best. As parents, we have heard students and parents and teachers 
    talk about how if it wasn't for electives, some students would not stay 
    in school. </p>
  <p >Indeed, we have <b>two types of students. </b>Those who <b>(1)</b> come for the academics and discover the joys of the electives, and <b>(2)</b> those who come only for the electives and, in the process, are guided 
    toward learning as well. </p>
  <p >In another recent article in The Oregonian (&quot;Arts Education Barely 
    Visible,&quot; 10-29-98, p. C10), we read that many students have said, 
    &quot;The bonds that art and music can create within a school are special, 
    perhaps unique,&quot; that, as stated about one school, &quot;choirs bring 
    pride and esprit de corps to a school that doesn't always triumph on the 
    grid iron. . . . &quot; Thus, there are those for whom it is choir (or 
    other art or music) that &quot;helps keep them on board. &quot; And yet 
    the article notes some schools don't have any. </p>
  <p >In other words, eliminating electives and extracurricular activities 
    undermines the very academic goal sought in the new requirements. Conversely, 
    keeping them helps the schools' efforts to achieve learning by the students 
    in a peaceful/orderly manner. </p>
  <p >&quot;The times they are a changin. &quot; <b
>Generation Y</b> has been identified as those between the ages of 13 and 19. 
    They equal, in number, the baby boomers. It took 15 years to produce the 
    baby boomers. It has taken only 6 to produce generation Y. Things are 
    going to get very interesting, very complicated, and very messy. This 
    is why developing a joint <b>&quot;school mission marathon&quot; </b>process 
    to address these issues is urged upon all schools. </p>
  <p >The boredom of the routine needs to be relieved. Electives relieve. 
    Most adults get training time, conferences, etc. , all things away from 
    their routine, hence, by any definition, enchanting. Building on that 
    understanding, it is urged that motivational and uplift assemblies be 
    developed or contracted for the kids, not fewer assemblies. Bottom line: <b> </b>alcohol, tobacco, other illegal drugs, undesired behavior, etc. 
    , become defacto enchantment without other choices and electives. </p>
  <p >Finally, how do we deal with the disenchantment of seemingly tolerated 
    school teasing or hazing that some feel is part of the growing up process 
    and not to be stopped? How do we deal with the statements of the fellow 
    students of the Columbine killers: <b>[</b>&quot;It Still Hurts: For 
    Columbine Students, The Struggle isn't Over,&quot; Mindy Mink, Upfront, 
    etc. , pp. 11-15<b
>]</b> who admit &quot;When we were freshmen, the senior class used to be able 
    to get away with a lot of stuff„picking on kids. Just pushing them around, 
    teasing them. „They did get teased. They did get persecuted a lot. &quot; 
    Now those activities get students expelled. &quot; Fight or flight&quot; 
    still overrides &quot;flow&quot; for many kids. Just feeling insecure 
    and afraid that one is going to be teased, let alone physically bothered, 
    shuts down the cerebral cortex and prevents learning. This is why, empirically, 
    biologically, brain wise, it is important that school all be &quot;peace 
    action&quot; zones. <b></b></p>
  <b> </b>
  <p>6. The Internet<a name="Internet"></a> (reach, richness, affiliation, 
    and navigation): Integrating it into the Education Marathon Discussion</p>
  <p >Despite the efforts to wire every school and classroom to the Internet, 
    one is struck by the resistance towards it from some educators, saying 
    &quot;itôs a fad, it will go away,&quot; to a resistance to computers, 
    with some saying &quot;we don't have to learn them; its not in our contract,&quot; 
    to those who hail computers and the Internet as the salvation of education. 
    And yet there are a number of sites that have been developed for education 
    (as witnessed when consulting to EdView, an educational web site with 
    a catalog of sites for elementary, middle and high school (information, 
    outlines, tutorials, background, lessons, etc. , which was subsequently 
    sold to the Encyclopedia Britannica and then to Disney). Dispite this 
    and other kindred sites, this resistence is still out there, creating 
    a credibility gap between teachers who refuse to use it and their students 
    who know it like the back of their hand. </p>
  <p>This is due in part to the fact that many dealing with education, in 
    and out of the classroom, confuse science with technology. As the physicist 
    Sheldon Lee Ghashow <b>(</b>The End of Science? Attack and Defense, 1992, 
    Nobel Conference XXV, Gustavus Adolphus College, p. 23-25<b>)</b> has 
    noted, technology is not science although it is the &quot;designer fruit&quot; 
    of science. Science is a &quot;unified, universal, objective endeavor&quot;. 
    The &quot;laws of physical Science are objective: they are among the fewthings 
    agreed upon by all of the family of man&quot;. The reason why we have 
    such a struggle with education is that education is not a science; even 
    its practicioners cannot agree. </p>
  <p>Both technology and education are &quot;certainly socially influenced 
    and culture dependent. &quot; Just as some wand a &quot;kinder and gentler 
    education,&quot; with an emphasis on self esteem, others suggest the same 
    for science, wanting &quot;a new kinder and gentler science be invented 
    with Force replaced by Love, and Power by Tenderness. &quot; The philosopher 
    Sandra Harding, who seems to confuse science and culture, believes that 
    science needs to be reinvented because it is &quot;inextricably connected 
    with specifically masculine needs and desires,&quot; and because science 
    cannot serve to &quot;make sense of women's social experience,&quot; it 
    must be re-invented as &quot;there is nothing morally and politically 
    worth redeeming in the scientific world view. &quot; However laudable 
    her social goals may be in the service of the cause of feminism, they 
    do not change the fact that the underlying truths of the fundamental laws 
    of Nature do not vary from one culture to another, although the interpretation 
    of what they mean or might not mean for human beings does vary. </p>
  <p>Indeed, both Harding and Ghaslow were both addressing the XXV Nobel Conference 
    at Gustavus Adolphus College in 1989. As the Nobel laureate Ghashow points 
    out in his presentation, &quot;Science enables Technology, which opens 
    up enormous and rapidly growing ranges of human opportunities. &quot; 
    (p. 25)Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are just as possible 
    as death, slavery, and the endurance of misery. Society, not science, 
    determines its means and goals, and determines the uses to which science 
    is placed. Society/culture can hobble science. Take two examples, Islam 
    and China. </p>
  <p>Prior to the doctrine of &quot;Taqlid&quot; being instituted in the Islamic 
    world, that no truth exists beyond that revealed in the Koran, Arabic 
    astronomy, chemistry and mathematics were unrivalled. With Taqlid, scholars 
    were banished (p. 26). This is why they have such a hard time with the 
    modern world and why &quot;fundamentalism&quot; has taken such a hold 
    in those countries, and has probably contributed to the Oslow Middle East 
    peace process is not working. </p>
  <p>The Chinese invented gunpowder, the compass, and &quot;were the greatest 
    navigators on earth until they decided, in the 15th century, that nothing 
    beyond their Celestial Empire was worthy of discovery&quot; (p. 26). The 
    result? They burnt their great ocean going ships, 50 years before Columbus 
    set said for the East by sailing West. Only now are they playing catch-up, 
    much to the detriment to the economic and social development of the largest 
    population on the planet. </p>
  <p>Ghashow believes that science as science &quot;remains the one bold hope 
    for the resolution of earthly problems such as pollution and illiteracy. 
    &quot; (p. xi), that science &quot;offers the last great hope for a humane 
    and lasting society. &quot; (p. 23). . In other words, science can serve 
    society and education to the extend we are willing to accept what is proven 
    vs the extent to which we first want its findings to fit some preconceived 
    notion or ideology or nationalist sentiment before such findings are considered. </p>
  <p>The Internet comes under this heading, and how we view it will determine 
    its utilization. The Internet has been called by teachers and educators 
    everything from a passing fad to the greatest boon to education since 
    Guttenberg's press. There are those who embrace it because of its ability 
    to deliver enormous quantities of information quickly and cheaply, and 
    there are those who reject it because it precisely for the same reason, 
    that it so much information. There are those who embrace it as a technology 
    that can replace colleges to those who believe that the issue is knowledge, 
    not information, and that true knowledge cannot be attained without the 
    give and take of a class room instructor interacting with students. But 
    the Internet is not science. It is technology. It is a tool. How it can 
    be and should be used should be a central point of discussion for the <b
>mediated marathon on education</b> proposed in the Columbine postscript. </p>
  <p>Let us suggest for discussion's sake that money is like trees and that 
    the Internet is like money/trees. Centuries ago, trees were cut down to 
    provide fire wood. In China, this meant destroying whole forests, with 
    the result that China today does not have the aerable land needed to feed 
    its population. Were it not for the discovery of coal, the same would 
    have happened in England. And were it not for the discovery of oil, the 
    same would have happened in the United States. </p>
  <p>The question, in terms of fuel, now centers on atomic power. France, 
    to avoid dependency on foreign oil has converted to atomic power. Nuclear 
    physics provides a source of power free from the oil spills of ocean going 
    tankers, acid rain from smoke stacks, black lung disease of the coal mine, 
    environmental problems that accompany strip mining, and the greenhouse 
    effect of emitted gasses. The question remains regarding its long term 
    safety (Chernobyl and Three Mile Island immediately come to mind) and 
    disposal of nuclear waste (of the latter, the U. S. does not reuse while 
    France does. In reusing it, France has eliminated that problem and the 
    contentiousness regarding moving such materials through various states 
    to their depositories. </p>
  <p>In this example, the Internet is what replaces firewood in education. 
    The graphs on education show a steady increase in spending. As China's 
    need for fuel absorbed her trees, so too does education absorb tax dollars, 
    fostering tax revolts when the numbers get too high. There may even be 
    a correlation in the drop of education spending with the subsequent rise 
    in spending for prisons. The Internet means more bang for the buck, higher 
    productivity, and a way of managing and distributing learning in a manner 
    far cheaper that current methods. </p>
  <p>The Internet provides a way of delivering information and knowledge, 
    along with tutorials and other aids, that can be delivered nearly cost 
    free in contrast to the current system. </p>
  <p>Again, how the Internet can be and should be used should be a central 
    point of discussion for the proposed mediated marathon on education. It 
    is one of the great area to focus on to discuss institutional change. 
    With all classes having their own web page, with the syllabus and homework 
    easily available to check by students and parents alike, as well as assignments 
    and due dates, and where the teacher can link to a dozen or so sites related 
    to the topics and content of the class, an enormous amount of the time 
    and expense over current methods can be eliminated. It is the &quot;new 
    fuel&quot; to provide more with less. Many problems in education, from 
    rich to poor districts, may well find that the Internet, used creatively 
    and openly, can resolve many of the learning issues while also saving 
    enormous costs. </p>
  <p>Kids today are Internet and computer savvy where their parents are not, 
    who in turn were TV savvy but their parents were not, who in their turn 
    were radio savvy whose parents were not. Before that, change was slow. 
    Now it is rapid. The Internet has the technology to harness entertainment 
    and education (sometimes combined as &quot;edutainment&quot;). </p>
  <p>This information cracking plant for the future will feature hands-on 
    and distant learning in a new kind of school house which will still, virtually, 
    serve the old school houses as they transition to the new kind of information 
    school house for the 21st century. This is why a societal wide dialogue 
    is needed. </p>

  <p  style='tab-stops:22.0pt'>It is like turning the fable of the tortoise 
    and the hare on its head. It is not so much competition as it is complementary 
    collaboration and cooperation. The Internet is the hare. The school building 
    is the tortoise. The key is to blend the speed of the information economy 
    and the fast moving nature of high tech discoveries/inventions and development 
    with the slower moving nature of the bricks and mortars of schools, in 
    order to keep up with fast paced change with minimal disruption and maximum 
    cost effectiveness. The hare is unstable but fast. The tortoise is too 
    stable and can hardly move. Together they compliment each other, one bringing 
    stability the other the dynamic of rapid changes in both technology and 
    content. </p>
  <p  style='tab-stops:22.0pt'>As Pomerleau and McGuire point out in their 
    white paper, &quot;Merging Physical Plants and Virtual Plants: A Strategy 
    for Business Success,&quot; the pre-Internet world of form and space/place 
    is now gone, replaced by what the Internet brings to bear: &quot;a complex 
    virtual environment that exists parallel to the familiar physical environment 
    with its own architectural possibilities. &quot; They then ask, &quot;How 
    can we best use the unique opportunities of this new environment? &quot;They 
    state the dramatic change this way: &quot;Leaders across fields, as architects 
    of the models in which they work, must define their vision and intent 
    in reference to the Internet. They must grasp the scope of the online 
    environment and . . . undertake the reinvention of the institutional models 
    through which their vision is to be realized. &quot; We now live in a 
    &quot;real/virtual&quot; world. This too is what our proposed educational 
    mediated discussion marathon, must address. The complete Pomerleau and

  <p  style='tab-stops:22.0pt'>The Internet brings to the table a new economics

    constantly had to trade off between <b>reach</b> and <b>richness</b>,

    The salesman making a call has great richness of information but little

>7. Clearing<a name="Clearing"></a> up the ìsix blind men elephant specters&quot;: 
    contesting the facts, answering the question, interpreting the &quot;mile 
    markers&quot; for winning a school mission marathon, in order to win the 
    prize of reducing/eliminating future Columbines from the educational scene 
    in America</b></p>
  <b> </b>
  <p >In the old Jack Webb TV show, Dragnet, the famous question was &quot;Just 
    the facts, just the facts. &quot; Columbine reminds us of the Hindu fable 
    of the six blind men and the elephant, which reminds us of the excitement 
    and terror of living in a world of multiple realities. Each of the blind 
    men examined the elephant &quot;that each by observation might satisfy 
    his mind. &quot; And so each one, investigating a part &quot;knew&quot; 
    that the elephant was like as a whole. Each part yielded a different answer 
    to what the elephant was like: side &quot;like a wall,&quot; tusk &quot;like 
    spear,&quot; trunk &quot;like a snake,&quot; knee &quot;like a tree,&quot; 
    ear &quot;like a fan,&quot; tail &quot;like a rope. &quot; They brought 
    their observations together and &quot;disputed loud and long,&quot; as 
    &quot; each was partly in the right and all were in the wrong. &quot; 
    The fable ends with these chilling lines: &quot;The disputants„rail on 
    in utter ignorance of what each other mean and prate about an Elephant 
    not one of them has seen!&quot;</p>
  <p >Hence, in the same way that the six different &quot;truth&quot; produced 
    not more truth but more argument, so today all engaged in education have 
    a part of the truth, a piece of the mosaic that makes up the whole. And 
    is not this the spectre that haunts the 21st century: how to settle the 
    competition between the competing visions and programs for the future 
    without incurring the devastation and misery of the 20th century? The 
    ten models discussed above in Section 3, for conflict resolution, enable, 
    using Peter Berger's terms, allows the modesty of the &quot;postulate 
    of ignorance&quot; about one's own view and a &quot;cognitive respect&quot; 
    for the views of others, in order to exercise a &quot;calculus of meaning&quot; 
    and a &quot;calculus of pain&quot; to reduce the negative unintended consequences 
    and embrace the positive unintended consequences, so as not to be the 
    &quot;fanatic&quot; convinced that he or she &quot;has all the right answers&quot; 
    nor the &quot;technician&quot; who denies &quot;that there are any deeper 
    questions. &quot; He urges &quot;intellectual self-discipline&quot; (pedantry) 
    combine with &quot;utopian imagination&quot; to create &quot;pedantic 
    utopianism&quot; through &quot;research and teaching. &quot; The word 
    heresy comes from the Greek word &quot;herein&quot; which means choice. 
    Education used to be determined by fiat of experts. This would enable, 
    in his term, a positive and fruitful &quot;contestation&quot; between 
    the different interpreters of the elephant, as each exercises his or own 
    &quot;heretical imperative? &quot;Following the same method of rational 
    induction, each came up with a different answer. In their arguing they 
    turned to using reduction, reducing their arguments to what each felt. 
    A proper contestation would instead use induction, so that instead of 
    arguing the whole from a part, each part would be used to gain insights 
    into the whole. The process will take time. It will be a <b>marathon. </b>But Columbine reminds us that not only is the effort worthwhile to 
    undertake, it is necessary. </p>
  <p >We have chosen to concentrate on education, as &quot;Public-opinion 
    poll after poll indicates that Americans' No. 1 concern is education&quot;

  <p>1. How should the discussion factor in the fact that even though the 
    rate of violence is down among teenagers and rising among their elders? </p>
  <p>2. How do we compare ourselves to the past, when, for example, in 1997 
    Los Angeles experienced 33 homicides per 100,000 people, whereas in 1855 
    the number was 414 per 100,000 people? </p>
  <p>3. What about the headlines that although &quot;Columbine is forever 
    changed by rampage&quot;, no resolution exists, as &quot;despite the tragedy 
    at the high school a year ago this week, then rational debate about violence 
    remains as unresolved as ever. &quot; </p>
  <p>4. How do we deal with what students say, as reported by them to state 
    attorney generals that violence is mostly influenced by their homes? The 
    2000 National Association of Attorneys General report, reported on the 
    anniversary of Columbine, concludes that, &quot;overwhelmingly, students 
    told the Attorneys General during our listening conference that the primary 
    cause o youth violence lies in the home. &quot; </p>
  <p>5. How do we deal with the situation that &quot;with the prevalence of 
    single parents, two-career families and 60 hour workweeks, much of the 
    'raising'&quot; of children is done outside the home? </p>
  <p>6. How do we answer the comment by the Kabit-Zinns, in their book Everyday 
    Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting, when they say (p. 20) 
    that today's problems &quot;are staggering and all-pervasive, and are 
    creating a society in which it is increasingly difficult for families 
    to raise healthy children. &quot; </p>
  <p>7. How do we factor #3 in with the reality that many have thrown in the 
    towel with kids, that, as Molly Ivins reported that Public Agenda, a public 
    policy research group, in a 1997 poll, discovered that &quot;we don' like 
    our own children. &quot; And: &quot;80% of us think it is uncommon to 
    find parents who are good role models for their children. &quot; How does 
    this square with the constant comment of many that either the schools 
    should provide parenting or who accuse the schools of producing behavior 
    in students which was actually produced at home? </p>
  <p>8. In the same article, Ivins reports on documents of a meeting of the 
    American Correctional Chaplains Association that &quot;may help us&quot; 
    understand the preceding three paragraphs: &quot;Among the words of wisdom 
    at the gathering were these from Carol Vance of Texas: 'What causes crime 
    is not drugs, alcohol, unemployment or low educational levels. It is caused 
    by persons who grew up in chaotic home situations, abused as children, 
    without any appropriate guidance or direction, deep in pain through the 
    lives they lead, who are trying to escape their circumstances. '&quot;</p>
  <p>9. With the tight restrictions clamped down on many schools after Columbine, 
    how do we deal with the cover story of U. S. News and World Report, April 
    17, 2000: &quot;The Good News About Teens: A year after Columbine, kids 
    are doing a lot better than anyone thought,&quot; and the inside article 
    &quot;Teens Get Real&quot; and its sub-heading, &quot;Adolescents get 
    a bad rap today, but many are choosing an unfamiliar route: Doing good&quot;</p>
  <p>10. How should reports that schools are not teaching kids how to read 
    and write be factored in? </p>
  <p>11. How shall those involved come to realize and act on the truth of 
    one of the central tenants of W. Edwards Deming, which is <b
>that the problem is not people but the system</b> in which they have to work. 
    Change the system and you will solve the problems. In this light, Mary 
    Walton's The Deming Management Method 3 . is recommend. This is echoed 
    by the best selling business author Ken Blanchard, who says that &quot;People 
    are not the problem,&quot; as &quot;most performance problems are not 
    the fault of people, but of systems. &quot; What does this say about how 
    serious we ought to be at looking at the working of the &quot;system&quot; 
    of education? This is also echoed by Robert Watts, as seen in the title 
    of his book, People Are Never the Problem; People HaveProblems. </p>
  <p>12. Would looking at the system, and not the people, create effective 
    change? In Peter's home state of Oregon, a Washington, D. C. based child 
    advocacy group, &quot;The Children's Rights Council, ranked Oregon 40th 
    among states in a survey on the best places to raise a child. In addition, 
    Oregon performed most poorly in the area of juvenile crime, high school 
    dropouts, divorce, prenatal care and child immunization. All of this is 
    reported under the headline of &quot;State's low rank for kids takes few 
    by surprise. &quot; </p>
  <p>13. How is the debate between academic achievement standards vs. self-esteem 
    standards to be handled: both/and or either/or, and why? </p>
  <p>14. How is the overall educational system to be dealt with when there 
    are so many conflicting &quot;solutions&quot; proposed (ranging from <b>(1)</b> the some who would do nothing to <b>(2)</b> the some who would lock them 
    down with metal detectors, locked doors, armed guards, to <b
>(3)</b> the some who want to profile every student regarding risk potential and 
    either counseling them or putting them in special schools, to <b>(4)</b> the some who want to increase self-esteem training, to <b>(5)</b> the 
    some who want to re-evaluate and restructure education, either within 
    the system or outside the system (independent charter schools, vouchers, 
    for-profit education alternatives, etc. ), to <b>(6) </b>the some who 
    would focus on the teachers unions, to either eliminate them or increase 
    their authority and responsibilities, to <b>(7)</b> the some who either 
    do or don't believe in our country (in the 60's there was little faith 
    expressed by the left; in the 90's it was the right; where will either 
    fall in the 2000's? ), to <b>(8)</b> the many who would like to see a 
    dialogue started to find a middle ground on which all can stand, students 
    and adults alike as well as public and private institutions and any and 
    all regardless of where they stand on the various political and cultural 
    ideological spectrums)? </p>
  <p>15. How shall Jeff Greenfield's comment and question to the Democratic 
    presidential candidates' debate at the Apollo Theater on February 21, 
    2000 be factor, in which he asked: ìin light of the different proposals, 
    from revolutionary improvement to gradual improvement to public choice 
    and private alternatives, how do you respond to this question: if, after 
    35 years and $100 billion in Title I money, with SAT scores gap not narrowing, 
    why not conclude that the opposition to choice is an example of the support 
    of special interests and not the interests of students? How do you defend 
    and account for this incredible potential unfulfilled? &quot;</p>
  <p>16. He also asked what should be done about the fact that 800,000 times 
    last year some student took a gun to school, more education or more incarceration. </p>
  <p>17. <b>How can business help? </b><b
>What role should business play? </b>There are those who don't see how business 
    can be a part of the discussion. Those still of that mind are urged to 
    read the article by Bernard Avishai, &quot;What Does Business Owe Society? 
    &quot;Avishai demonstrates that <b>all</b> of us are stakeholders. Avishai, 
    a retired CEO, calls for business and corporations to step up to the plate 
    in this game we call education. His article answers his title question, 
    &quot;What Does Business Owe Society? &quot; (4th qt. 1997 issue of Booz 
    Allen's &quot;Strategy &amp; Business&quot;). His article speaks directly 
    to our shared concerns. His piece can be read in fullat <b>http: //www.

  <p>18. A favorite line in the article is this, as it addresses most of our 
    concerns succinctly: </p>
  <p  :.5in;tab-stops:right 1.5in'><b
>Is it possible that what most conventional educators mean by the evaporation 
    of their students' self-discipline is that, given the experience of television, 
    students no longer have the capacity to be bored to death? &quot;</b>(p. 
    7)</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText>To this one could add movie theatres, movie videos 
    and DVD's, music CD's, MTV and its videos, and scores of TV stations, 
    whether broadcast, cable and/or satellite, from which to choose. One could 
    also look to what Mary Pipher calls &quot;the toxins&quot; of our culture. </p>
  <p>The following reflect just a few Avishai's points (emphasis added) which 
    underscore the reality of <b
>both/and</b> of numerous options, as opposed to either/or approach. The both/and 
    could be achieved by engaging in a joint <b>school mission marathon</b>. 
    More points by Bernard Avishai: </p>
  <p>ç &quot;25% of the current American work force is not sufficiently educated 
    to be qualified for jobs that would pay enough to sustain the middle-class 
    life&quot; p. 4</p>
  <p>ç &quot;this means that 10 or 20 or 30 million people -- people with 
    children, people hobbled by dullness and self-doubt, people who played 
    by rules that simply evaporated from the time they were 15 to the time 
    they were 35 -- are hard pressed to see a future. &quot; p. 4</p>
  <p>ç &quot;companies contribute to democratic solutions by remaining capable 
    of creating the wealth shareholders and governments appropriate, not by 
    taking on the responsibility of governments. &quot; p. 5</p>
  <p>ç China's education program contributed to its economic takeoff, making 
    them a place foreign corporations could build factories and have educated 
    labor waiting for them. Ditto Israel and Singapore. . p. 6</p>
  <p>ç Taxes for education should be seen as a &quot;necessary investment 
    pool, not a redistributive levy on profits&quot;, that they should not 
    be seen as some anti-business tax, as companies can't teach the basics, 
    seeing public schools as being more like &quot;specialized graduate schools 
    than elementary schools. &quot; p. 6</p>
  <p>ç &quot;Governments currently spend upward of a quarter of a trillion 
    dollars nationwide on schools of all kinds. &quot; He calls for more <b>[</b>spending<b>]</b>, 
    especially for dealing with those falling through the cracks, the underclass, 
    the abused, etc. , as he calls for everything from wellness facilities 
    to &quot;thousands of Outward Bound-like programs,&quot; etc. p. 6</p>
  <p>ç Motorola spends $5 million yearly &quot;in cooperative programs with 
    K-12 systems for schools and community colleges&quot;. p. 7[Note: Motorola 
    University has programs showing superintendents and principals, FREE, 
    how to apply in TQM to education]</p>
  <p>ç <b>Companies should &quot;get into the education business&quot;. </b>If 
    a company is a learning organization it is also a teaching organization. 
    &quot; He urges companies to &quot;offer services to children and teen-agers 
    and profit from the enormous education market that is taking shape before 
    our eyes. &quot; p. 7</p>
  <p>ç Part of what companies can do: &quot;develop teaching materials -- 
    theoretical articles, multimedia software, instructional films, on-line 
    simulations and so forth -- that reflect their peculiar competitive experiences 
    and advantages. <b>There is no reason why companies cannot market these 
      products to school boards and universities, to new entrepreneurial teaching 
      enterprises and to families. &quot; </b>p. 7</p>
  <p>ç About his prescriptions, Avishai says &quot;I wish I could say that 
    I expect other business leaders to adopt these attitudes before things 
    get much worse. But I can tell you that many more will adopt them as things 
    get worse. &quot; p. 8</p>
  <p>19. From David G. Myers, The American Paradox: Spiritual Hunger in an 
    Age of Plenty, we find that the words Charles Dickens used to open A Tale 
    of Two Cities apply to us today: &quot;It was the best of times, it was 
    the worst of times. &quot; In Myers first chapter he lists what is &quot;best&quot; 
    about and what is &quot;worst&quot; about us, and in his last chapter 
    he offers a list of guideposts for interpreting our elephant. How shall 
    we use them? </p>
  <p>20. From a different perspective, how do we deal with the reality of 
    the contradiction that we, as Americans, are weddedsimultaneously to materialism 
    and spirituality, resulting in recurring struggles between morality and 
    economics (Robert Fogel, The Fourth Great Awakening &amp; The Future of 
    Egalitarianism). </p>
  <p>21. In looking at the debates regarding religion in the school, how dies 
    Peter Berger's notion that Americans are as religious as the people of 
    India, whereas much of education is presided over by an elite as secular 
    as Sweden's? </p>
  <p>22. How can the enormous regulatory burden of the Federal Department 
    of Education be reduced, a burden which can account for 6% or more of 
    a school budget just to keep up to date with the paper work? </p>
  <p>23. Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of Public Instruction: 
    &quot;Everyone is complicit in trying to make the education system look 
    good without merit. &quot; &quot;This country is so content not to know 
    the truth about its children, its horrifying. &quot; [Arizona: the self-proclaimed 
    &quot;chicks in charge state,&quot; where the Governor, Secretary of State, 
    Treasurer, Attorney General and president of the State Senate are all 
    women]</p>
  <p  style='tab-stops:right 27.0pt 1.5in'>24. Now that Internet access is 
    almost universal (homes, schools, libraries, community centers), combined 
    with much cheaper computers and electronic &quot;appliances,&quot; how 
    do we structure the use of existing facilities such that the so-called 
    &quot;digital divide&quot; is narrowed, not widened? </p>
  <p>25. In a world more and more turning to English as the lingua franca, 
    how do we change bilingual education from a defacto permanent end to a 
    program of transition to a common language for all? </p>
  <p>26. How do we close &quot;the significant opportunity gap&quot; identified 
    by the May 2000 White House Conference on Teenagers? </p>
  <p>27. How do we deal with Ellen Goodman's question of how to deal with 
    post Dr. Seuss books like Honey Bunny, Funnybunny, used in pre-school 
    training, in which the message is that any kind of attention is good, 
    even if it is the torment of teasing (meanness? ) or more serious verbal 
    or physical abuse? </p>
  <p>28. How does the &quot;A Vision for Education&quot; cover story of the 
    May-June 2000 The Futurist, which calls for a &quot;radical&quot; change 
    allowing students and teachers more flexibility and control fit into the 
    equation? </p>
  <p  :12.0pt;tab-stops:right 27.0pt 1.5in'>29. How does the contents of the 
    book Interpreting Education: Science, Ideology, and Value, by Abraham 
    Edel, fit into the contestation discussion, as he discusses education 
    and education institutions within the context of the education structures 
    put in place as permanent when education operates in a world that is impermanent? </p>
  <p>30. How do we deal with the statistics of 1 in 4 High School freshman 
    not completing their high school degrees, and two in three college freshmen? 
    What is the impact of what the December 1999 Ladies Home Journal has called 
    &quot;The Binge Generation,&quot; of students going on wild drinking sprees 
    and putting their lives at risk? On the other hand, could we say that 
    these represent that segment of youth who are going to drop out anyway, 
    such as discussed in the book &quot;Riding the Rails: Teenagers on the 
    Move During the Great Depression&quot;? On the other hand, states the 
    author, many were told to leave: &quot;I can't afford to have you around 
    any longer. &quot; Are our current drop outs merely a new version of these 
    boxcar boys and girls and the desperation that drove them away from home? </p>
  <p>31. Another contest: school vouchers v. regular public schools vs. charter 
    schools. </p>
  <p>32. What about Douglas Carnine's book, Why Education Experts Resist Effective 
    Practices, in which he shows that despite the evidence that &quot;Direct 
    Instruction and similar highly scripted approaches to teaching&quot; are 
    the most effective approaches (what used to be called lectures), they 
    are resisted. The evidence: the federal Project Follow Through, which 
    may be &quot;the most thoroughgoing investigation in the history of educaton 
    research, involving 70,000 students in 180 schools using a variety of 
    teaching techniques. &quot; The other techniques, discovery learning, 
    language experience, developmentally appropiratepractices, and open education, 
    &quot;often performed worse. &quot; Why isn't it promoted? Carnine: because 
    the closed circle of true believers -- educators and educationists -- 
    for whom evidence is less important than faith, believe in it. </p>
  <p>33. How do we resolve the contest over how the brain develops, and the 
    debate which, on one hand, give great value to parental impact (The Developing 
    Mind, Daniel J. Siegel), and the opposing view that the parents' role 
    is minimal because the real influence is one's genes (The Nurture Assumption, 
    Judith Rich Harris, and The Myth of the First Three Years, John Bruer? </p>
  <p>34. How do we deal with research over 20 years showing that &quot;large 
    schools„don't work for many children, or at least don't allow them to 
    reach their full potential,&quot; so that we should build &quot;more small 
    schools, not fewer large ones, and„turn large schools into smaller ones&quot;? </p>
  <p>35. How about the standards movement and the accompanying scandals of 
    cheating by students (to get higher grades) and teachers (to get higher 
    achievement marks)? </p>
  <p>36. How do we continue to reverse the bashing of the U. S. begun by the 
    politics of the left in the 1960's and continued by the politics of the 
    right in the 1990's, and get kids to feel proud about and determined to 
    contribute to what Georgie Anne Geyer calls &quot;the real legacy of the 
    20th century,&quot; which is the &quot;many freedoms&quot; we have, and 
    that the U. S. has spent the &quot;American Century spreading liberty&quot;, 
    so as to bring the schools on board what Peter Berger calls carrying an 
    agenda of &quot;The Culture of Liberty&quot;? </p>
  <p>37. How do we deal with the August 30, 1999 Business Week article entitled 
    &quot;Kids were right all along: High school is obsolete,&quot; advocating 
    ending it at 10th grade? (p. 146)</p>
  <p>38. How do we deal with the figure in the 1st quarter 2000 issue of Strategy 
    &amp; Business, that bring the schools up to speed with E-education, school 
    improvements, more training, and information technology, is a transformation 
    which will cost $740 billion? </p>
  <p>39. With some teachers still refusing to learn to use computers and to 
    learn how to surf the Internet, how do we deal with that reluctance and 
    the belief of some teachers that the Internet is a fad (as has been told 
    to the authors of this piece), how do we reconcile their reluctance (the 
    July 1998 Atlantic Monthly article on teaching machines noted that all 
    machines prior to the Internet were blocked by teachers; they have been 
    unable to block the Internet) with these comments from the March 2000 
    issue of Red Herring: The Business of Technology magazine: &quot;Can the 
    Web Fix Education? &quot;&quot;Some see the Internet and private enterprise 
    as saviors of public education. Others view them as unwelcome intruders. 
    &quot; &quot;The big move toward using the Internet and things like home 
    schooling is happening because people are dissatisfied with our failed 
    public schools. &quot; And: even so, the article quotes Nicholas Lemon, 
    who praises public schools: &quot;Rather than being irrelevant or unnecessary, 
    public schools are more relevant than ever&quot; and &quot;It should be 
    as hard to get a bad public school education as it is to buy spoiled meat 
    in the supermarket. &quot; Finally, we have these two statements: in terms 
    of &quot;higher webucation&quot;: &quot;you can't replace the experience 
    of going to college. A university is not defined by technology; it's defined 
    by its students, teachers, and culture&quot;AND &quot;There are a bunch 
    of startups out there taking a Web-based approach, putting content on 
    the Net where everyone can reach it and teachers can manage it. &quot; </p>
  <p>40. How do we factor in the cover story, &quot;The Choices for Children&quot; 
    of the March 6, 2000 The Nation magazine, from their three lead stories, 
    &quot;Education and the Election,&quot; &quot;Leveling the Playing Field,&quot; 
    and &quot;Myths of 'Social Promotion'&quot;? </p>
  <p>41. How do we factor in these &quot;contemporary theses&quot; of Dr. 
    Carl E. W. L. Dahlstrom into the <b>school mission marathon</b> advocated 
    as an excellent method <b
>for resolving the macro and micro conflicts: </b></p>
  <p> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The American young are ours (and yet so many adults don't like them 
      and many felt it was OK to kill them at Kent State during the demonstrations 
      against the Vietnam War). </p>
    <p>2. Responsibility is multiple (even though many adults say they have 
      no responsibility for the young). </p>
    <p>3. Two or more monologues do not make a dialogue (which is why the 
      kind of school mission marathon, following the insights of Section 3 
      on the Macro and Micro models of conflict resolution), is advocated. </p>
    <p>4. The American young will have to understand that education is a privilege. 
      In other words, responsibility is for all. </p>
    <p>7. Without a moral consensus, a society will waver more or less disastrously 
      between anarchy and despotism. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>42. Who will usher in a <b>school mission marathon? </b>And if the reader 
    participates, which of the six blind men examining the elephant does he 
    or she represent? Can we not, in a <b>school mission marathon,</b> regain 
    our sight, and see not only the parts but the whole, and in doing so, 
    have a &quot;contestation&quot; that is win-win for all of the contestants? </p>
