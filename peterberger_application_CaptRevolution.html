      <h2><strong>ApPlication of Peter Berger</strong></h2>
    <p>Key Principles of Peter L. Berger:&nbsp;Vis a Vis Sociology of and the  Sociology of Knowledge as they Relate to Social Roles, Social Stratification, Social  Inequality, and Justice, Peter J. Jessen, Reader, 1993</p>
    <h3> Propositions from Berger&rsquo;s  &quot;Capitalist Revolution&quot;</h3>
        <p> <strong>EXCERPTS&nbsp;FROM:  &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/44GuideForPlanning.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Solution Paper #44, posted May 21, 2011,&nbsp;Guidelines  for Including Justice in Planning Meetings</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to Calculate a Better Future  for Minneapolis in terms of education, jobs, housing and public safety</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>by engaging in  a&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;contestation&rdquo;&nbsp;between competing public policy idea sets.</strong></p>
        <p> from Conclusion,&nbsp;<strong>pp.  315-317</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>Not Losing Sight of the Prize  of Equality&rsquo;s Freedom</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>Without economic  participation and equal access and equal opportunity for prosperity, the past  will continue to be repeated.</strong>&nbsp; Whites may be willing  to pay that price.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp; This is evidence from studies around  the world, from Peter L. Berger,&nbsp;<em>The  Capitalist Revolution:&nbsp; Fifty Propositions About Prosperity, Equality,  &amp; Liberty</em>&nbsp;(Basic Books, NY, NY, 1986, pp. 211-215<em>:</em></p>
        <p> Proposition #1:&nbsp; Industrial  capitalism has generated the greatest productive power in human history</p>
        <p> Proposition #5:&nbsp; Advanced industrial capitalism has generated, and  continues to generate, the highest material standard of living for large masses  of people in human history.</p>
        <p> Proposition #12:&nbsp; In all advanced industrial societies education has  become the single most important vehicle of upward mobility.</p>
        <p> Proposition #16:&nbsp; Capitalism is a necessary but not sufficient condition  of democracy.</p>
        <p> Proposition #22:&nbsp; At least in Western societies, if not elsewhere as well,  capitalism is the necessary but not sufficient condition of the continuing  reality of individual autonomy.</p>
        <p> Proposition #28:&nbsp; Capitalist development in Third World societies leading  to rapid and labor-intensive economic growth is more likely to equalize income  distribution than strategies of deliberate policies of income distribution.</p>
        <p> Proposition #30:&nbsp; East Asia confirms the superior capacity of industrial  capitalism in raising the material standard of living of large masses of  people.</p>
        <p> Proposition #40:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The movements toward  democracy and individuation in East Asia have been greatly strengthened by the  adherence of these societies to an international capitalist system centered in  the West.</p>
        <p> Proposition #48:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be no  effective market economy without private ownership of the means of production.</p>
        <p> <strong>The following seven commonly  held values (pp. 218-221) are held by more people around the world than any  others (regardless of what their political leaders may like or say or put forth  in the contest over ideas and values that often keep their people from  benefiting from these values).</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>These seven values are far better  fostered and far more greatly delivered by democratic capitalism than by  socialism or &ldquo;third way&rdquo; approaches, and relate directly, in my mind, to the  inner-city of Minneapolis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The material well-being of people, especially  of the poor</li>
          <li>Equality (equity, equalities, reducing  inequalities)</li>
          <li>Political liberties and democracy (freedom)</li>
          <li>Protection of human rights (civil, political,  economic, cultural, religious), i.e., &ldquo;protection of individuals and groups  against the most common acts of tyranny (massive terror, arbitrary executions,  torture, mass deportations, the forced separation of families,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;protection  against economic misfortune&rdquo; (the purpose of welfare)</li>
          <li>Individual autonomy</li>
          <li>Preservation of tradition&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Community</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I list the above for those still waffling  between the left and right extremes and their agendas.&nbsp; We cannot  understand the importance of education, housing, and jobs, without first  keeping clear, that&nbsp;<strong><u>the  empirical evidence</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;shows  that more people have been brought out of poverty by capitalism, and that  &ldquo;democratic regimes have the best record on the protection of human rights  in&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>all</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;the categories employed by  human rights theorists.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> I list these for two simple  reasons:&nbsp; first, less than 8% of small businesses in America are Black,  and yet most jobs are created in small businesses.&nbsp; Secondly, minorities  will not succeed in business unless they have the education to do  so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> This has been&nbsp;<em>The Minneapolis Story Through My  Eyes</em>.&nbsp; What will be The Minneapolis story over the next  decade?&nbsp; What dreams will be envisioned?&nbsp; How will visions be  sustained?</p>
        <p> We have come a long way from the day when  we had to ride in the back of the bus.&nbsp; We have come a long way since the  time we weren&rsquo;t even allowed on the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Now we have come to the time where  it is important that we also drive the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p> We have just finished the 20th century, a  century of many dreams, ranging from capitalism to socialism, from far Right to  far Left, from Hitler and Franco and Mussolini to Lenin and Stalin and  Mao.&nbsp; Their dreams, as we have seen, were very costly.&nbsp; Their visions  were death traps.&nbsp; From the perspective of these men, it is wonderful for  us that the 20th century is over.&nbsp; But what will we envision for the  21st?&nbsp; What will we dream for the next decade?&nbsp; How might what I have  written about the Minneapolis story help with future visions, future dreams?</p>
    <p>This legacy question is not as easy as it sounds.&nbsp; We all  want to be remembered for our positive things, not our negative.&nbsp; A  guiding light of mine is that you only pass this way once.&nbsp; And probably  one of the greatest disservices that we can do to our legacies, to our souls,  is to have passed this way and done nothing.&nbsp; And so, I&rsquo;d like to be  thought of as having done a number of things that helped others and maybe in  some small way led to positive change.&nbsp; That basically is it.&nbsp; But  what I seek is more than the final story of Ron Edwards.&nbsp; The real legacy  that I want to keep alive is the legacy of the struggle to keep the eye on the  equality&rsquo;s prize of freedom.&nbsp; It is my hope, my intent, that this will be  the legacy which all of us can lift up for the young Black men of our city.  </p>
