      <h2><strong>ApPlication of Peter Berger</strong></h2>
    <p>Key Principles of Peter L. Berger:&nbsp;Vis a Vis Sociology of and the  Sociology of Knowledge as they Relate to Social Roles, Social Stratification, Social  Inequality, and Justice, Peter J. Jessen, Reader, 1993</p>
        <h3>More Solutions</h3>
        <p><strong>FROM: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/44GuideForPlanning.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Solution Paper #44, posted May 21, 2011,&nbsp;Guidelines for  Including Justice in Planning Meetings</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to Calculate a Better  Future for Minneapolis in terms of education, jobs, housing and public safety</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>by engaging in  a&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;contestation&rdquo;&nbsp;between competing public policy idea sets.</strong></p>
        <p> Originally  published in November 2002 in&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="http://www.theminneapolisstory.com/" target="_blank">The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</a></strong></em>, by Ron Edwards as told to  Peter Jessen, pp. 297-299, 300, 315-317, 320-322. </p>
        <p> <strong>EXCERPTS from&nbsp;p.300</strong>&nbsp;of  Chapter 17:&nbsp;<em>The  Positive Future&nbsp;Possibilities&nbsp;for&nbsp;</em><em>Minneapolis</em></p>
    <p> <strong>It is time that all Blacks be included at the table</strong>.&nbsp;  One of the great tools offered citizens by the United States is the mechanism  of asset management that most take for granted.&nbsp; It allows assets to  become liquid and turned into something else, such as investment money from the  mortgage on a home or building or cash for your kid&rsquo;s education.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>But to have investment income one  needs a living wage with some discretionary money left over to invest</strong>.&nbsp;  To make asset management work means having not only laws that enforce private  property rights but also laws that prevent its theft, whether stolen by the  private sector or public sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Much inequality is not due to capitalism, but due to  many being forced out of it, whether forcibly (see Interlude 8) or through  benign neglect (Chapters 7-9).&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Education is the key for  all in our modern society.&nbsp; When we offer public education to the poor and  inner city that does not teach the key tools of reading and writing, or when  housing is kept out of reach by depressing wages below livable levels that  don&rsquo;t allow making mortgage payments combined with practices that deny  mortgages to minorities, then we have said you are not welcome at the table.</p>
    <p> Ancient King Solomon asked for wisdom to  discern what to do.&nbsp; The facts of this book can give us the wisdom to know  what can probably work and in all probability what will not work.&nbsp; In  his&nbsp;<em>Pyramids of  Sacrifice,</em>&nbsp;Peter Berger gives us&nbsp;<strong>a &ldquo;recipe for discerning whether  what we are doing is wise or not, by giving us a calculus to use, one of  meaning and one of pain.&nbsp; I have attempted to use this recipe in our  accepted YESes and common NOs of Chapter 5.</strong>&nbsp; This book has  addressed&nbsp;<strong>the  &ldquo;calculus of pain&rdquo; of racism and Jim Crowism</strong>&nbsp;<strong>in terms of the immense human costs  borne</strong>&nbsp;by those who did not request or conceive the  projects but were forced to live under them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Public policy needs modesty</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Public policy needs wisdom.</strong>&nbsp;  Imaginations are still needed.&nbsp; But so too is the wisdom with which to use  them and wisdom with which to judge the consequences of those  policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Hence  the YESSES and NOs, the ultimate&nbsp;<u>contest of ideas, a &ldquo;contestation&rdquo;  between our ideals and an examination of them in both economical and  ideological terms.</u></strong><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>The Senator who tried  to have family live a week on the minimum wage was a good start.&nbsp; Every  legislator, Federal and State and City, should attempt to live on the minimum  wage for at least a week (although a month would be more of a learning  experience).&nbsp; Then we could really get serious in talking about positive  future possibilities.  </p>
    <h3><strong>More&nbsp;Propositions from Berger</strong></h3>
    <p> <strong>Excerpts from Solution  paper #22,&nbsp;7 KEY THEMES, 7 KEY PROBLEMS, and 7  KEY SOLUTIONS,&nbsp;August 31, 2003</strong></p>
    <p> e. Explore the propositions of Peter Berger, as listed in the  Conclusion of my book, p. 315. Use as a base the seven values held universally  around the globe by many, as a starting point, on p. 316, in the Conclusion.  Explore the theses of Peter Berger on p. 297 of my book, Interlude 16.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> f. Call &ldquo;a family meeting&rdquo;: as has been pointed out elsewhere,  back in the year 2000, Dave Jennings, (with the school district as of this  writing), in discussing the stadium problem, said &ldquo;someone other than the teams  have to create a public discussion about the future of the Twins and the  Vikings in Minnesota. The teams are crying out for somebody to call the family  meeting&rdquo; (Star Tribune,8-10-00). So too, the problems outlined in my book call  out for a public discussion, for a &ldquo;family meeting.&rdquo; Who should call it? Why  not the Urban League, the NAACP, or the two together? How about a newspaper? A  company? A coalition? A church. A church denomination. Let the family meeting  be called. Let the conversation begin. Use this Solution Paper to develop the  agenda.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> g. Consider, for goals, the lists on p. 305 of Chapter 17, as  taken from the reports on the Watts Riots in L.A. and from the Kerner  Commission on the riots of 1967.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> h. Use as criteria for evaluating policies and actions the YESes  and NOs listed in Chapters 5 and 17, and use a calculus of meaning and a  calculus of pain (see Chapters 1, 5, 16 and Conclusion).&nbsp;</p>
    <p> i. Utilize the best that can be found in conflict resolution  models (see&nbsp;),  as well as the four questions on p. 321 in the Conclusion chapter.</p>
