  <p align="center"><b>APPENDIX L: 14<a href="confrescolum.html"> Models</a> of Conflict Resolution For Use in Wider Institutional or Wider 
    Area Stakeholder Process to Bring Resolution and Consensus</b></p>
  <p>Communities often seem &#147;at war&#148; over just about everything, 
    including stadiums, as if each entity in the community was competing against 
    each other, when, in reality, the real battle isn&#146;t over the team 
    or the stadium but over who pays for it, and the competition is not within 
    the city or twin city or tri-city, but between them and every other similar 
    grouping outside their area throughout the USA and the world.&nbsp; During 
    the days of low salaries all around, it made sense for the public to pull 
    together and provide funding.&nbsp; Today, in the era of billionaire owners 
    and millionaire players, the notion of&nbsp; requesting tax payers to 
    pay for a stadium to make them more money shows the tremendous change 
    that has taken place.&nbsp; However, there is good news.&nbsp; This model 
    shows how to finance the building of a new stadium without using tax payer 
    dollars.&nbsp; How is the gap to be bridged?&nbsp; How are &#147;fighting&#148; 
    or, at least, quarrelling groups to come to a common ground understanding 
    to allow conflict resolution?&nbsp; The answer we propose is to select 
    aspects from our 16 page paper highlighting 7 macro models and 7 micro 
    models of conflict resolution.&nbsp; To give an idea of such a need, think 
    of the current debate in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in 
    Minnesota over how to finance new stadiums for the pro-football Vikings, 
    pro-baseball Twins, and University of Minnesota Gophers college football 
    team.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This model would work for all three:&nbsp; the Twin Cities could build 
    all three with this model, IF they could resolve their conflicts.</p>
  <p>Red McCombs, Vikings owner is quoted as saying, &#147;Show me how.&#148;&nbsp; 
    Dave Jennings, CEO of the Greater Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce, stated 
    in the Minn. Star Tribune on-line (8-10-01) that &#147;someone other that 
    the teams have to create a public discussion about the future of the Twins 
    and the Vikings in Minnesota.&nbsp; The teams are crying out for somebody 
    to call the family meeting.&#148; &nbsp;The model we propose gives any 
    who would provide leadership the means to resolve the conflicts in order 
    to move forward with the stadiums.&nbsp; This model is an example of what 
    a leader or leadership group needs to best serve everyone involved on 
    these teams, from owner to fan, from coach to player.&nbsp; The 14 &quot;models&quot; 
    presented below could be used, singly or combined, by all with a stake 
    in keeping the Vikings and Twins in town, both private and public sectors, 
    both professionals and non-professionals) by bringing them all together 
    to effectively discuss ways to resolve the questions the stadium issue 
    represents for all of Minnesota.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> The seven Macro Models (these being models between sovereign states 
    or major social institutions) are (1) Masada (Romans vs. Zealots, a &#147;how 
    to fail&#148; in conflict resolution, resulting in one side committing 
    mass suicide rather than give in to the other, and the other side willing 
    to kill them to make them give in), 1st century AD; (2) Germany after 
    World War II, regarding how the successful evangelical academies in helping 
    to rebuild West Germany and then helped with the process of integrating 
    East German; by following the cardinal rule that all sides must sit at 
    the same table; (3) the successful Helsinki Accords of 1975, which some 
    see as the precursor of the downfall of the USSR, for it urged a moral 
    framework and respect for people; (4) the successful &#147;third track&#148; 
    diplomacy of the Roman Catholic Church, of which the most recent success 
    was in Mozambique, and prior to that, their non-violent, moral based approach 
    in Chile, the Philippines, and South Korea; (5) the Oslo Accords, another 
    &#147;how to fail&#148; conflict resolution model, between the Palestinians 
    and the Israelis, from the 1990s, in which the basic framework is hatred 
    from one side and constant defense from the other, but never &#147;all 
    is negotiable&#148; stances from either, as the one side wants the total 
    elimination of the other, which is resolution through annihilation, and 
    the other wants to expel the other in order to achieve what is impossible, 
    a homogenous population;&nbsp; (6) the successful joint (Black-White) 
    mediation in South Africa to end apartheid in the 1990s, including Michael 
    Cassidy&#146;s &#147;the politics of love,&#148; also based within a moral 
    framework, and (7) the generic model of &#147;the politics of love&#148; 
    that came out of South Africa that can be used anywhere.</p>
  <p> The seven Micro Models (the face to face aspects, regardless of who 
    one represents) are (1) the Lose to Win spectrum for conflict mediation 
    resolution; (2) the 2 x 2 probability of outcome matrix of Mary Pipher 
    (author of Reviving Ophelia:&nbsp; Rescuing the Selves of Adolescent Girls; 
    (3) self talk, which is a part of overcoming &#147;learned helplessness 
    of Martin E.. Seligman, and part of the overcoming adversity formula of 
    CO2RE/LEAD of Paul Stoltz; (4) the &#147;managing conflict for individual 
    and team success&#148; of Sam Imperati; (5) the principles approach of 
    the &#147;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&#148; of Stephen Covey and 
    the positive approaches of Dale Carnegie&#146;s &#147;How to Win Friends 
    and Influence People,&#148; (6) the serve and love command for interpersonal 
    relations shared by both Jesus and the Buddha; and (7) the use of Lists/Recipes 
    for establishing goals and approaches for conflict resolution.</p>
  <p> The various conflict resolution models, derives from five key, over 
    arching concepts:&nbsp; </p>
  <p> FIRST:&nbsp; the social fact that humans have no instincts for human 
    interaction nor for keeping track of things, and that to survive, must 
    create &quot;instinct substitutes,&quot; which are call roles (hence, 
    as Peter Berger points out, no one can live a role free existence),.&nbsp; 
    Every situation in which any person finds themselves, is like a theatrical 
    stage, and each stage has its own called for role playing, behavior, costumes, 
    etc.&nbsp; No one can live a role free existence.&nbsp; People who get 
    into the &#147;habit&#148; of not cooperating or taking a wider vision 
    have a harder time with conflict resolution.&nbsp; SECONDLY, because of 
    this, anyone can, individually and collectively, be a playwright and participate 
    in creating the stages on which they play their roles, and the plays in 
    which they play their roles.&nbsp; Will the &#147;playwrights of the community&#148; 
    write a play of further conflict and animosity or a play of cooperation 
    and resolution?&nbsp; THIRDLY, individuals&nbsp; are capable of not only 
    living in multiple realities but of being able to emigrate freely back 
    and forth between them.&nbsp; Nothing, therefore, is inevitable.&nbsp; 
    All can be negotiated, worked out.&nbsp; FOURTH, This also means that 
    role playing is more important than one's feelings that no matter how 
    one feels, the old theatre adage that &quot;the show must go on&quot; 
    is far more prevalent as a reflection of the hard knocks of life than 
    &quot;when I get energized and feel great I will get going&#148;.&nbsp; 
    This must be the attitude of any who would overcome adversity and anyone 
    who would engage in the &quot;mediation marathon&quot; sometimes required 
    to resolve conflict.&nbsp; FIFTH, Lists/recipes for action are key to 
    organizing the thoughts and actions one needs to achieve goals.&nbsp; 
    Some of lists include those of Stephen Covey's &quot;7 Habits of Highly 
    Effective People and Families,&quot; Benjamin Franklin's list of 13 areas 
    for achieving personal and professional success, the list of Dale Carnegie's 
    success principles, the list of success principles of Napoleon Hill and 
    W. Clement Stone, 6 lists for goal setting by Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, 
    Robert Schuller, Peter Daniels, Paul Stoltz, and Napoleon Hill, as well 
    as a list of books of lists by Sam Deep and Lyle Sussman.</p>
  <p> Note that the 2 KEYS to all of these 14 models is their organization.&nbsp; 
    It is recommended that their organizational principles be that of (1) 
    &nbsp;L-I-S-T-S/R-E-C-I-P-E-S) (as part of goals, plans, contingencies, 
    time lines), and (2) c-o-l-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-I-o-n (with all as negotiable).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p> As Berger further points out, social scientists talk about the reality 
    that &quot;every society has its own corpus of officially accredited wisdom, 
    the beliefs and values that most people take for granted as self-evidently 
    true.&quot;&nbsp; In terms of stadium concept/approval/building, there 
    are multiple realities involved, each viewing the stadium and its benefits 
    differently, from the unique position of its own prism of reality.&nbsp; 
    This is important to understand, for, as Berger writes:&nbsp; &quot;Every 
    human society has institutions and functionaries whose task it is to represent 
    this putative truth, to transmit it to each new generation, to engage 
    in rituals that reaffirm it, and sometimes to deal (at least in words) 
    with those who are benighted or wicked enough to deny it.&quot;&nbsp; 
    This used to be an easy task when there was a dominant set of beliefs 
    and values that everyone took for granted.&nbsp; But modern society is 
    pluralistic, with multiple realities or worldviews that change, hence 
    the saying of W.R. Inage, that &quot;he who would marry the spirit of 
    the age soon becomes a widower.&quot;&nbsp; Hence the need for this model 
    and for the various model sets within, including the ones regarding conflict 
    resolution.</p>
  <p> There are two other organizing principles which we recommend for consideration 
    by both the macro models and the micro models, both also suggested by 
    Peter Berger.&nbsp; The FIRST is a &quot;calculus of meaning&quot; and 
    a &quot;calculus of pain,&quot; from his book Pyramids of Sacrifice:&nbsp; 
    Political Ethics and Social Change, in which he suggests that policies 
    should be those which provide the most meaning and the least pain, and 
    that each calculus include a list of outcomes that are not desirable, 
    in order to avoid the mistake of believing that because the intent is 
    pure, so will be the outcome.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> The SECOND, also from Berger, adapting from another of his analytical 
    frameworks, is to have each of the stakeholders in the discussions that 
    ensue review whether or not they are arguing from an ideological position 
    or not, whether they are actually flexible with their thinking, and to 
    ascertain whether or not they are being &quot;historically specific conservatives&quot; 
    or &quot;historically non-specific conservatives.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
  <p> This eliminates the argument over content labels (liberal vs. conservative, 
    Democrat vs. Republican), and instead focuses on the process.&nbsp; In 
    this way, it can be stated that both the radical left and the radical 
    right are, hopelessly and romantically, historically specific conservatives.&nbsp; 
    The radical left looks forward to a future putative utopia which, when 
    reached, is to be frozen in place, never to changed because utopia has 
    been achieved.&nbsp; The radical right looks backward to a putative golden 
    age which it wishes to resurrect, after which it too is to be frozen in 
    place, as the golden age has been retrieved, never to be changed, because 
    &#147;the best of times&#148; have been achieved.&nbsp; The historically 
    NON-specific conservative, on the hand, recognizes yet resists the impulse 
    to fine a &quot;perfect place&quot; and to then rest and keep it that 
    way, but also recognizes that it is better to make haste slowly, and that 
    as most historical actions have unintended consequences, one needs to 
    be slow in assuming that a proposed policy or action is the solution.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> The Spanish Civil War, which, like all wars, was a conflict &quot;full 
    of moral ambiguities, with unspeakable brutality on both sides,&quot; 
    in which a monument has been erected to the million who died, a monument 
    placed inside a mountain not far from &quot;The Valley of the Fallen&quot;.&nbsp; 
    Berger's chilling words about this should give us all pause and inspire 
    us to be &quot;historically non-specific conservatives&quot;:&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
    the Spain that is now emerging has nothing to do with what either side 
    fought and died for. &nbsp;&nbsp;Or, as Cassidy put it in his book, &quot;Apartheid 
    and all its works will pass away.&nbsp; So will every answer which replaces 
    it, whether better and nobler or yet more sinful and worse.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
  <p> The same is true of many American cities that have had too narrow a 
    vision to keep their professional teams only to either spend more money 
    later to replace them or suffer the loss of revenues that resulted.</p>
