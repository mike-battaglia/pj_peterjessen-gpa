  <p><b>2<a name="2"></a>. Executive Summary</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>PeterJessen-gpa.com is a pioneer in sports marketing from 
      the standpoint of presenting professional sports united in an embrace 
      with both the private and public sectors in order to better serve the 
      teams, the cities, the fans, and the tax payers of the cities.</p>
    <p>PeterJessen-gpa.com has created several sites and information 
      files that directly relate to the San Diego Chargers in general and 
      to the City of San Diego and Mission Valley in particular. This proposal 
      is an outline for acquisition of the web portal and information developed 
      by PeterJessen-gpa.com to better enable the stakeholders of 
      Mission Valley to create a comprehensive sports-entertainment-real estate 
      development complex in Mission Valley, a complex to be anchored by the 
      new stadium for the San Diego Chargers. Available is the domain name 
      and the web site (which can be expanded or absorbed into another site 
      created from scratch using the same domain name), as well as files of 
      related information.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3<a name="3"></a>. THE CURRENT REALITY</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="../images/sitephoto.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="324" align="right">1. 
      The stadium issues address all of the tough economic times ahead for 
      most cities in the future, promising jobs, revenue, and economic growth 
      for San Diego. Handled correctly, the stadium issue can help drive San 
      Diego&#146;s economy by creating jobs, generating investment, and helping 
      to maintain the team&#146;s importance to the quality of life of the 
      citizens of San Diego. </p>
    <p>2. The San Diego Chargers have been an integral part of San Diego culture 
      for nearly 40 years. The fans make the San Diego Chargers what they 
      are, and, as with all teams, they belong to the fans, which in this 
      case means 3 generations of fans. The Chargers have declared they wish 
      to remain in San Diego. They are a San Diego tradition. The web portal 
      created by PeterJessen-gpa.com can enable all to work together 
      so that the chargers can keep this tradition going!</p>
    <p>3. The new reality, the Complex, would be (1) a destination and a gathering 
      place for fans, visitors, tourists, consumers, and sports/entertainment/real 
      estate/business people, as well as (2) a business, real estate and communications 
      hub; these two together will generate profits in the near term and long 
      term, year around; and (3) a place that would also involve the non-profit 
      community of schools, community centers, and the faith community. </p>
    <p><a href="#s"><img src="../images/homebox.gif" width="30" height="30" alt="top" border="0" align="right"></a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>4<a name="4"></a>. THE DESIRED FUTURE REALITY: MISSION VALLEY MIXED 
    USE COMPLEX</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="../images/sitephoto2.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="266" align="right">1. 
      A large sports-entertainment-real estate development complex (built 
      above and below ground) as proposed has a wide range of positives: jobs 
      (covering the private sector unions), a wider tax base that would help 
      contribute more dollars for education (covering the public sector unions), 
      construction and the financing that goes with all of this (covering 
      the business community), additional spending regarding office buildings, 
      hotels, restaurants, retail shops, multiplex movie theatres, work force 
      housing, luxury housing rising above the retail space, and large event 
      hosting, including the Super Bowl at least once a decade (covering many 
      of both the small and large business communities), will provide for 
      planning also for tourists and game day people (covering the travel 
      and hospitality sectors), etc. 10 acres of parks covers the need for 
      public spaces as well.</p>
    <p>2. To maximize profits, professional sports needs to recognize its 
      real estate aspect (with the financing provided by the tenants and anchors, 
      which can also include recording studios). With so much parking, other 
      use facilities could be built, such as multi-plex movie theaters and 
      large event hosting. The same is true of public spaces. In order to 
      maximize these parts, the facilities would also be used to provide and 
      generate communications, including using an Internet web portal, providing 
      television and radio broadcasts, as well as generating print publications. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5<a name="5"></a>. THE ANCHOR FOR ACHIEVING THE CHANGE IN REALITY: 
    CHARGERS STADIUM:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="../images/sitephoto2.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="266" align="right">1. 
      Professional sports is now both big business and big entertainment.</p>
    <p>2. The offered web portal and information can be used to gain full 
      acceptance of the complex, city wide, to demonstrate its benefit for 
      all: fans/tax payers, law makers running for re-election, and owners 
      understandably wanting to have their business be profitable and competitive. 
      When Jerry Jones took over the Dallas Cowboys, they were losing $1 million 
      a month; but he had an off field vision that led to profitability. The 
      same will be true with the San Diego Mission Valley Complex anchored 
      by the San Diego Chargers. </p>
    <p>3. The offered web portal can enable the complex, anchored by the team, 
      to contribute significantly to the vital social fabric of the city/state/region, 
      providing a &quot;common ground&quot; fan experience of enchantment 
      around his or her water cooler, coffee pot, black board, TV, and/or 
      six pack (conversations at work, home, school, and play, for men, women, 
      and children of all ethnic and racial groups), in order to enchant, 
      enthrall and excite the fans in their &quot;iron cages of modernity&quot; 
      year round. This accomplished will set the stage for meeting the goal 
      of selling out home games and of having 80% of all TV sets tuned to 
      Charger games, both home and away. </p>
    <p>4. Such a complex will generate (give or take a few hundred million) 
      a benefit for the community and state to the tune of $1 billion in direct 
      dollars generated by having a professional football team, and $1 billion 
      in indirect dollars, all for greater San Diego.</p>
    <p><a href="#s"><img src="../images/homebox.gif" width="30" height="30" alt="top" border="0" align="right"></a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>6<a name="6"></a>. To make the plan work: get the word out there with 
    rapid releases and responses </b>via www.chargersstadium.com </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. This is a multi- or mixed use facility Sports, Entertainment, Real 
      Estate, Communications, Investment, Public Space Plan, outlining how 
      to raise $610 million in non-tax investment, with NO public funding 
      (only for infrastructure improvements (site preparation, streets, sewers, 
      hookup, etc.), normal to any large-scale development. </p>
    <p>2. The estimated Revenues of this plan are projected to be over $200 
      million/year, to start, through synergies for generating on-going revenues/profits/fan 
      support, utilizing 40 ways to generate revenue in 26 revenue generating 
      categories, including private and public space. This model includes 
      the outline of a strategic plan for securing the funding. </p>
    <p>3. Professional sports has become a large part of four major, emerging 
      and enormous growth industries, (1) learning/edutainment, (2) high tech 
      business solutions, (3) spin-offs from space exploration, and (4) tourism, 
      totaling a combined size of $3.245 Trillion.</p>
    <p>4. The Stadium Complex would be (1) a destination and a gathering place 
      for fans, visitors, tourists, consumers, and sports/entertainment/real 
      estate/business people, as well as (2) a business, real estate and communications 
      hub. These two together will generate profits in the near term and long 
      term, year around, because Dan Diego&#146;s weather encourages year-round 
      use.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>7<a name="7"></a>. The Web Site:</b> teaches, demonstrates, and helps 
    to create the desired positive response reality, especially when using 
    the domain name, web site, and additional information provided by PeterJessen-gpa.com, 
    especially regarding public relations, internet strategies, and smart 
    growth. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Have a &quot;rapid response&quot; policy (and criteria for when 
      to use it and when to leave it in the drawer) to combat the attacks 
      and hostilities from both print and broadcast media, in order to give 
      the stadium campaign a chance to influence the desired outcomes (all 
      falsehoods must be responded to, but only to the falsehood).</p>
    <p>2. . This model discusses how to maximize both internal and external 
      communications, including the use of the Internet and a team navigational 
      and informational web portal, as well as outlines a PR program for use 
      in the city/state/region/nation/world, as well as models of conflict 
      resolution for use in getting all of the business/governmental/fan stakeholders 
      in agreement.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>1. This is a &quot;Big Picture&quot; Vision. It takes elements of various 
      traditional financing plans and combines them into a new financing configuration 
      for a multiple use sports-entertainment property that relate to all 
      types of stadiums, even if they are in the same city or region. </p>
    <p>2. The portal can be used to reach the public as well as detractors 
      quickly and easily, so as to help keep the project on track and keeping 
      it from being derailed. PeterJessen-gpa.com has developed many Internet and other Communications 
      Strategies that can be used.</p>
    <p>3. The portal can be used to explain and encourage the public and to 
      make the case such that all, the citizens and the City and the Business 
      Community, can all work together to achieve the goal of the Complex 
      and the continuation of the Team and the Complex in the lives of San 
      Diegans. </p>
    <p>4. The categories of financing which the portal can be used to explain, 
      include:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. The $200 million that will come from the Chargers, both the NFL 
        and the Spanos Family.</p>
      <p>2. The $200 million that has to be put up from other sources, through 
        a combination of investors, developers, stadium and complex revenue 
        sharing, bonds backed by user fee increases in ticket and parking 
        revenues, etc.</p>
      <p>3. The web portal can be used to both explain and attract the comprehensive 
        sports-entertainment-real estate development project which could generate 
        revenue at least 40 different ways in 26 categories, at the last count 
        conducted by PeterJessen-gpa.com.</p>
      <p>4. On-going revenue: examples to explain using the Web Portal to 
        generate acceptance of the plan include: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(1) $60 million &#150; from 40 new Executive Suites at $75,000 
          each (City of San Diego could be offered 40% of these revenues for 
          20 years)</p>
        <p>(2) $100 million -- from real estate development investments in 
          the Com</p>
        <p>(3) $100 million &#150; from development bonds paid back from (a) 
          anchors and (b) smaller business located in both the stadium complex 
          as well as the wider complex outside the stadium.</p>
        <p>(4) $100 million from entertainment, office and retail space, hotels 
          and other residences, and other public space usage.</p>
        <p>(5) $50 million &#150; from the City for infrastructure (i.e., 
          normal city large project development costs: land and site prep, 
          streets and sewers, etc., source to be determined</p>
        <p>(6) $410 million total potential yearly revenue for the over all 
          complex</p>
        <p>(7) If the DreamWorks model is used, an investment pool equal to 
          this amount can also be generated.</p>
        <p>(8) This does not include the revenue to be generated by the Super 
          Bow, expected once a decade, of $250 million each time, nor the 
          hundreds of millions to be generated in greater San Diego in addition 
          because of the existence of this Complex. </p>
