  <p>I lived in Minneapolis 1989-1993, and ever since I delivered a key note 
    address there in 1981, at the downtown Marriott, I have always felt it 
    was one of the best cities in America, and have been involved consulting 
    to companies there for the past couple of years, and within that context, 
    got joyfully caught up in trying to resolve the stadium question, as explained 
    below.&nbsp; Tim has just sent out a well thought out 7 part statement, 
    which I will respond to after I send this piece.&nbsp; I originally had 
    sent along two attachments.&nbsp; I now understand the Forum doesn't forward 
    those.&nbsp; So, if you want to read what I say is attached, Email me 
    and I will send them to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider myself a &quot;Friend 
    of Minnesota,&quot; and specifically a &quot;Friend of the Vikings,&quot; 
    a &quot;Friend of the Twins,&quot; a &quot;Friend of the University,&quot; 
    and a &quot;Friend of the Metrodome.&quot;&nbsp; This is my valentine, 
    my gift for success to all of you and them. Here is what I sent to the 
    US1 Forum, modified in a special section below to fit Minnesota:</p>
  <p>Peter Jessen Email of 6-26-01 to Politalk discussion <br>
    on Public Financing of Stadiums, modified for Minnesota <br>
  </p>
  <p>My name is Peter Jessen, and I currently live in Portland, Oregon, and 
    have done consulting in New York City, Washington, D.C., Minnesota and 
    California.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have an available attachment of a 58 page Model 
    for Funding Stadiums using minimal public funds (other than the usual 
    one would expect, streets and sewers).&nbsp; For a copy Email me at&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    peterjj@peterjessen-gpa.com.&nbsp; The first 31 pages answers the question 
    of how to finance a stadium without public funding.&nbsp; The remaining 
    pages provide background information and outline some tools that could 
    be used to bring disparate groups together to finalize putting together 
    a stadium without public funds.&nbsp; The model addresses issues relating 
    to the good of BOTH the teams AND the citizen-tax-paying-fans.&nbsp; For 
    those who want the quick summary, there is a one page executive summary 
    on page 1, followed by a 7 page executive briefing, after which the Models 
    three parts are discussed in detail: </p>
  <p>I.&nbsp; Team Stadium ( including&nbsp; 8 ways to finance any stadium, 
    followed by 40 ways in 26 categories to generate revenues on an ongoing, 
    yearly basis.&nbsp; Please note:&nbsp; we only list 8 ways to finance 
    one or more stadiums per city, rather than more, as explained below).</p>
  <p>II.&nbsp; Team Operations and Player Compensation (including a 12 part 
    compensation plan, suggesting a change from the management-union model 
    to a &quot;senior executive team&quot; model, 5 public-partnership approaches 
    that generate revenue for both team and city,&nbsp; and a call for an 
    emphasis on being competitive (which is sustainable in a way everyone 
    trying to be the end of the season sole winner is not).&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    rationale for this is in Appendix E of the Model.&nbsp; Appendix I discusses 
    &quot;Harnessing the Internet to Save Ten's of Millions in Operations 
    Costs&quot;.</p>
  <p>III. Communications (including&nbsp; internal and external communications, 
    the development of an internet strategy and web portal for any team, and 
    20 means for maintaining on-going communications.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appendix 
    F of the model discusses &quot;The 'Four Corners' Approach to Building 
    Community Support.&quot; Appendix J discusses &quot;Establishing a Team 
    Navigational Web Portal,&quot; with both a free side and a subscription 
    side.</p>
  <p>The Model follows three simple &quot;mantras&quot;:&nbsp; (1) that there 
    is indeed a non-tax way of profitably funding a stadium and running a 
    team, (2)&nbsp; protect the game, whatever it is; in other words, don't 
    kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, and (3) take a leadership role 
    by providing and disseminating a workable and acceptable financing/revenue 
    model.&quot;</p>
  <p>The Model's title states the &quot;new&quot; way/paradigm shift/new lens 
    of perception/thinking outside the box, call it what you will,&nbsp; that 
    will enable teams to profitably build and maintain stadiums and their 
    teams:&nbsp; A Multi-Use Sports-Entertainment MODEL for Profitably Building 
    and Operating a Professional Sports Stadium/Arena/Team/Franchise,&nbsp; 
    with the statement that this model is &quot;Applicable to any major stadium 
    program, e.g., Football, Baseball, Basketball, Hockey, Universities, etc.&quot;</p>
  <p>A stadium complex can also be used for housing, jobs, education, etc.&nbsp; 
    Good people, trying to do good things together, can make it happen.</p>
  <p>I only recently learned of this marvelous exchange of politely, and thus 
    joined only this weekend, and was delighted and encouraged to learn that 
    this exchange re public financing of stadiums would be continued another 
    week for the Minnesota group.</p>
  <p>The debate as I have followed it today seems to center not so much on 
    how to fund stadiums without public funds, as it does on either&nbsp; 
    resisting public financing for stadiums, without any replacement method, 
    or finding a way to finance it with &quot;some&quot;, usually in the $100-200 
    million dollar range, with such &quot;low&quot; amounts perceived as if 
    it were little.&nbsp; The attached model provides such a replacement.</p>
  <p>The discussion has also centered on a timeless debate:&nbsp; whether 
    a cities taxes that would otherwise fund schools, housing, social services, 
    transportation systems, etc., should be sacrificed for the enjoyment of 
    suburban ticket holders, i.e., providing for the well healed out of city 
    folks at the expense of city kids.&nbsp; Also getting mixed up in the 
    discussion is a huge antipathy against corporate profits interleaved with 
    anger about perceived needless corporate welfare, again being at the expense 
    of those in the city for whom the taxes should be spent, especially for 
    education and moderate housing, job training, moving people productively 
    off of welfare, etc.&nbsp; Again, the discussed model shows you can have 
    stadiums without diverting tax dollars to stadiums and still get stadiums 
    that serve both the team and the community as well.&nbsp; Appendix G&nbsp; 
    of the&nbsp; model deals with the realities of dealing with &quot;Utilizing 
    Minority Business Enterprises (MBE) and Handling Minority Issue Management 
    (MIM).&quot;</p>
  <p>The good news is that all seem to be genuinely sincere about their beliefs 
    and positions.&nbsp; And yet there are some very diametrically opposed 
    positions, the most basic being the topic of this discussion:&nbsp; to 
    use public funds or not to build stadiums.&nbsp; The model I can send 
    you (peterjj@peterjessen-gpa.com) shows how to fund stadiums without public 
    funds.</p>
  <p>We got into this by accident.&nbsp; My friend Otis Courtney, of Eden 
    Prairie, MN, began www.vikingsstadium.com two years ago to help generate 
    support for the a new stadium for the Minnesota Vikings.&nbsp; Otis asked 
    me to help put his dream together.&nbsp; Learning of the need by the 49ers 
    as well, we first prepared a proposal to the 49ers and then later modified 
    for the Vikings on how each could build new stadiums without public funding 
    (other than the usual infrastructure of streets and sewers, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    To date, both the 49ers and the Vikings seem to believe they will get 
    public funding.&nbsp; We don't share that view.&nbsp; We would love to 
    work with them &quot;if&quot; (their viewpoint) or &quot;when&quot; (our 
    viewpoint) the legislative approach doesn't work.&nbsp; There are more 
    than 8 ways to fund stadiums.&nbsp; Indeed, Otis received many funding 
    suggestions from fans to the www.vikingsstadium.com site, some very sophisticated, 
    that could be integrated into any plan to finance the stadium.&nbsp; We 
    recommend that teams seeking new stadiums should put up a similar website 
    and hold a contest, offering a pair of season tickets, to the best idea 
    submitted.</p>
  <p>A stadium building friend of Otis&nbsp; asked us to develop our proposals 
    as a generic piece, as he stated this should be every league's team model.&nbsp; 
    That is what is attached.&nbsp; It was done in May.&nbsp; Perfect timing 
    for our just learning of this Forum.</p>
  <p>Briefly:&nbsp; government has always funded development of new industries 
    and getting things started (shipping, banks, canals, trucking, rail roads, 
    any transportation, tel-coms, even the 1st 25 years of the Internet, etc.).&nbsp; 
    But, once established, the government butts out except for certain tax 
    relief and other such programs or end of year Christmas tree legislation, 
    and then they stand or fall on their own.&nbsp; It is worth noting that 
    over half of the Fortune 500 companies of the 1970's no longer exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Pro Sports risk losing out to other sports or activities or TV shows if 
    they don't get their houses in order and begin celebrating the game and 
    serving the fan rather than going on and on about how they need new stadiums 
    at public expense so they can afford to attract free agents, or else they 
    will move.</p>
  <p>Teams and owners are not being evil.&nbsp; They are caught in what could 
    be called &quot;an old paradigm.&quot;&nbsp; Also, because so many other 
    stadiums have been publicly funded, why can't theirs?&nbsp;&nbsp; Paraphrasing 
    a political&nbsp; slogan, we could say &quot;its the system, stupid.&quot;&nbsp; 
    W. Edwards Deming, creator of the Deming Management Method, says &quot;it 
    is not bad people but bad systems that are the problem.&quot;&nbsp; When 
    he approached Detroit regarding how to build a better quality car through 
    TQM (total quality management), he was shooed out of town.&nbsp; He went 
    to Japan, revitalized Japanese industry, including and especially their 
    automobile industry.&nbsp; Kids raised on those better cars didn't even 
    think of American cars, and thus in two generations, the U.S. auto industry 
    lost a lot of market share to the Japanese (and Germans and Swedes).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were successful because the &quot;old paradigm/lens 
    of perceptions&quot; of the likes of IBM, prevented them from staying 
    ahead of &quot;the event horizons&quot;, losing all of that value to Microsoft 
    and Apple.&nbsp; Gates and Jobs came in with not only new visions, but 
    new systems.&nbsp; Their new vision was for a desk top computer on everyone's 
    desk, whether at work or at home.&nbsp; IBM and the computer establishment 
    said not enough would buy them (indeed, the founder of IBM argued with 
    his son and successor that IBM had no business getting into computers 
    as the world would only need seven or so; needless to say, the son won).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> As pointed out in the book FutureWealth, the great losers in the 60's 
    and 70's were the BUNCH (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell), 
    whereas the losers in the 80's were the minicomputer makers:&nbsp; Wang, 
    Datapoint, Data General, and DEC.&nbsp; Now we see consumer electronics 
    suppliers, common carriers, and many tel-co's being brought to the brink 
    (and we haven't even mentioned the dot.coms), although one could make 
    the point that much of this is because government has not stepped in to 
    enforce the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which was supposed to solve the 
    problem of the bottleneck of the &quot;last mile,&quot; by allowing competition 
    from the CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers), so that new monopolies 
    are being created, which is not competitive and which has dramatically 
    slowed the expanding of broad band connections, which the dot.coms needed 
    to deliver their services (I trust the irony is not lost on the reader 
    that the new monopolies are the remaining Baby Bells who are becoming 
    the monopolies AT&amp;T was broken up to prevent).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Major sports leagues are run by good people with, at the most optimistic, 
    a system that doesn't work well any more and prevents greater profits 
    because of its structure, and, at worse and most pessimistically, a system 
    which will implode on themselves if it is not fixed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The &quot;parity&quot; principle of the NFL needs to be a part of all 
    leagues.&nbsp; Indeed, the competition is not other teams but other sports, 
    and if the teams of the Big Three (NFL, NBA, MLB ) don't stop fighting 
    each other in terms of revenue and salaries (team management fighting 
    team players and team managements fighting each other), they will lose 
    to other sports, for if we accept that professional sports are entertainment, 
    then we must take &quot;an entertainment dollar&quot; viewpoint, and in 
    the end, the market will determine where people feel they will get the 
    best bang for their buck, and how much they want to spend to be entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    And if players keep jumping teams, fans will follow players, not teams, 
    and make them even more apt to jump sports, to spend elsewhere while they 
    follow their favorite two or three players, and when they move, that means 
    no longer supporting the local team.&nbsp; Our proposed 12 part compensation 
    plan for players covers this.</p>
  <p>Things have changed for players too.&nbsp; In the &quot;old days,&quot; 
    when players didn't make much and had to get jobs in the off season (hence 
    the need for training camps, which were really conditioning camps), communities 
    and owners worked together.&nbsp;&nbsp; It made sense for local communities 
    (states and or cities) to help foot some or a lot of the bill in those 
    days for stadiums and arenas.&nbsp; Those days are passed.&nbsp; New stadiums 
    are being promoted as needed not because they can't make money as now 
    structured, but because without them&nbsp; billionaire owners can't afford 
    to pay millionaire players more millions to keep them from leaving under 
    free agency (bad system, remember?).&nbsp; What greater sign that times 
    have changed.&nbsp; Personal anecdote:&nbsp; a family friend in the 1950's 
    had a starting pitcher on the Chicago White Sox:&nbsp; his &quot;fee&quot; 
    for advertising Lazy Boy Chairs was to get a free on delivered to him 
    home.&nbsp; That is no longer the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fans are going &quot;no 
    mas.&quot;</p>
  <p>There are backlashes out there. &nbsp;Canadians refused to allow Federal 
    funding of $3 million for each team, and so their teams and players are 
    heading for the states.&nbsp; Floridians just cheered their legislature 
    refusing to consider building stadiums for the Marlins, and the Devil 
    Rays would get the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a wonderful piece on &quot;Beware 
    The Coming Corporate Backlash&quot; at &nbsp; http://www.industryweek.com/CurrentArticles/asp/articles.asp?ArticleId=1006 
    .&nbsp; For those who don't want to wade through it, I can send you an 
    attached a copy of it with emphasis added through bold and underlining&nbsp; 
    (email me:&nbsp;&nbsp; peterjj@peterjessen-gpa.com ).</p>
  <p>Both owners and players and legislators and businessmen and fans, have 
    to step back and out of the small box of &quot;the old days,&quot; and 
    figure out how to expand the box to include where they now must stand:&nbsp; 
    &quot;the new days,&quot; of no public funding per se, except for infrastructure 
    streets and sewers and certain public-private partnerships (discussed 
    in Part II.B. of our&nbsp; Model).</p>
  <p>The good news: &nbsp;teams don't need public money (they want it, but 
    that's different, and even though they can say &quot;the other teams got 
    it so we should&quot;, that doesn't count anymore either).&nbsp; Even 
    the CEO of&nbsp; Archer Daniels Midland,&nbsp; G. A. Andreas, the largest 
    Agribusiness in the world, admitted to the TV show 60 minutes, that ADM 
    doesn't need government subsidies, but as long as others are taking them, 
    they will too.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our model shows how to build a new stadium without increasing team debt 
    or having to use public funding other than the usual streets and sewers 
    infrastructure.&nbsp; Our model also includes, as noted above,&nbsp; a 
    12 part compensation model to insure that both sides get what they need:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    teams not having to spend vast sums of cash in signing bonuses, etc., 
    and players not winding up broke&nbsp; 5 years after playing, as happens 
    with at least 50% of players (one estimate is 80%).</p>
  <p>Teams need to see themselves as part of the &quot;Sports Entertainment&quot; 
    industry,&nbsp; and think about year round revenues in doing so, not just 
    seasonal ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within this context, our&nbsp; model shows, 
    as noted,&nbsp; 40 ways in 26 categories of how to generate revenues using 
    the complex year round.</p>
  <p>An example of our simple thesis applied:&nbsp; Minnesota could fund ALL 
    THREE STADIUMS they desire (news ones for NFL Vikings, MLB Twins, and 
    U of MN Gophers) as well as take care of the Metrodome, with this model, 
    and all four could and would be profitable.</p>
  <p>Added for Minnesota:</p>
  <p>Minnesota is in a unique situation:&nbsp; three groups want stadiums:&nbsp; 
    the NFL Vikings, the MLB Twins, and the U of MN Gophers.&nbsp; It is said 
    that Minnesota can't support three new stadiums, and therefore at least 
    one team should leave town.&nbsp; My model suggests otherwise, based on 
    this key statement:&nbsp; the Twins still get their fans out; the Vikings 
    still get their fans out; and the Gophers still get their fans out.&nbsp; 
    Therefore, all three are supported now and can be in the future.&nbsp; 
    The Metrodome is not exactly the &quot;odd man out.&quot;&nbsp; However 
    as it is no longer &quot;viable&quot; in today's economics, and as it 
    is paid for, it doesn't matter whether the kind of creative thinking of 
    this model is turned to show how it can be sustained also, or whether 
    it is torn down for a new kind of development.</p>
  <p>What to do?&nbsp; When Red McCombs was asked this question, he said, 
    &#147;I don&#146;t know.&nbsp; Show me.&#148;&nbsp; This models does so.&nbsp; 
    Dave Jennings, CEO of the Minneapolis-Bloomington Chamber of Commerce, 
    said, &#147;in the 8-10-00 Star Tribune on-line, that &#147;someone other 
    than the teams have to create a public discussion about the future of 
    the Twins and the Vikings in Minnesota.&nbsp; The teams are crying out 
    for somebody to call the family meeting.&#148;&nbsp; So far, no one has 
    stepped forward.&nbsp; Maybe the people of this Forum could do so.</p>
  <p>Here are my thoughts about the three leagues, the new reality re stadiums,&nbsp; 
    and then my thoughts about all four of these Minnesota entities.</p>
  <p>About the NFL, NBA, MLB:&nbsp; I'm not an expert.&nbsp; My research as 
    primarily been on stadium building/operating.&nbsp; But I've learned a 
    little.&nbsp; The NFL has the most rational system, because of Pete Rozelle's 
    leadership which led the owners to adopt &quot;parity.&quot;&nbsp; This 
    gives all teams a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leagues without parity are hurting 
    themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; If only the teams in a few large cities can afford 
    to buy the best athletes, they hurt the game and the league.&nbsp; George 
    Steinbrenner is not a genius:&nbsp; but he is in the right place at the 
    right time:&nbsp; the most populous nexus of three states (I worked in 
    Manhattan for 5 years, and it is commonly called the Tri-State Area:&nbsp; 
    NY, NJ, CT), with the most TV stations, and so he is &quot;gifted&quot; 
    the revenues they generate simply by being there.</p>
  <p>The reality of the &quot;new&quot;&nbsp; financing:&nbsp;&nbsp; with 
    league-wide rules, etc., teams before didn't have much chance to be creative.&nbsp; 
    By enabling teams to have larger stadiums with built in money making sources, 
    good management has a chance to be successful, and not so good management 
    exposes itself, and properly so, to the &quot;creative destruction&quot; 
    of capitalism (as half the Fortune 500 in the 1970's) takes its effect 
    and requires them to sell to someone who can or to change their way of 
    doing business.&nbsp; When Jerry Jones took over the Cowboys, they were 
    losing $1 million a month.&nbsp; He reversed that by creatively using 
    his stadium as a base for other revenue generating activities.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The Vikings were sold because the former owners despaired that they 
    could ever get a new stadium deal with tax money (they were correct) and 
    therefore decided to sell before the team was no longer profitable.&nbsp; 
    In five years it won't be profitable (see Appendix D of the Model).&nbsp; 
    The Twins have hung on by following non-debt business practices and investing 
    in its future with its farm clubs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other side of the new 
    reality is the fact that most teams in the NFL have new stadiums or have 
    new ones approved and are on the drawing boards.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I believe only the Vikings, Saints and maybe a couple of others, are 
    without new stadiums in hand or approved and under planning.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Baseball's contraction is based on not having new, publicly funded stadiums.&nbsp; 
    They need to use this model.&nbsp; Teams have to get new stadiums or go 
    where they can.&nbsp; The problem with the question in Minnesota is that 
    it is improperly phrased as an either/or question:&nbsp; either stadiums 
    are public funded or the teams have to leave town (Viking, Twins) or be 
    disbanded (Twins).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is odd that in the greatest democracy 
    of the world with the greatest capitalist economic engine in history, 
    that capitalists of so many sports teams are asking for non-capitalist 
    solutions.&nbsp; Better is the both/and approach:&nbsp;&nbsp; both teams 
    and communities can thrive and survive by cooperating together, so that 
    each gets what it needs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember from above regarding how the old industries got started:&nbsp; 
    government subsidies.&nbsp; What the pro sports teams don't realize is 
    that those days are gone.&nbsp; Some teams are trying other methods to 
    survive.&nbsp; Several years ago, either Harpers or The Atlantic ran a 
    piece&nbsp; on the MLB's San Diego Padres, who had opted out of the free 
    agency race, and got rid of all of its highly paid players, in order to 
    say financially sound.&nbsp; Fans could still enjoy a night out, ticket 
    prices could be kept reasonable, and they could see all of the big name 
    stars when they came to town on the other teams.&nbsp; Finally, &quot;system 
    wise,&quot; teams and players need to drop the anachronistic notion that 
    they are management-union.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Hard working hard hats and other unionists struggling to provide for 
    their families are done no favors and are demeaned when players say &quot;we 
    have a right to strike because we too need to put food on our family's 
    table,&quot; as the then NY Knick Pat Ewing said.&nbsp; Player are not 
    union workers.&nbsp; They are all senior executives and key performers 
    of a major entertainment enterprise.&nbsp; Compensation so structured 
    would enable costs to be kept down, enable teams to make more profits, 
    and enable players to make more money.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Remember, it is not revenue that counts, but profits.&nbsp; Raising 
    ticket prices and building new stadium only to turn the new revenue and 
    then some (as some go into debt to do so) over to ever higher player salaries 
    could eventually result in stadiums with full Suites and empty stands, 
    as Joe Fan and his family migrate to the new sports and to the minor leagues 
    of the majors.&nbsp; Again, the 12 part compensation plan in the Model 
    addresses and resolves this issue.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Also, Appendix H is a two page summary of my recently written&nbsp; 
    30 page &quot;Model of 10 Competitive Analysis Components for Long Term 
    Profits,&quot;&nbsp; which if applied by these four entities would insure 
    their staying out of the red in terms of revenues.&nbsp; Other trends 
    supporting the Model are listed in Appendix B of the&nbsp; Model.&nbsp; 
    Another key question is: will Minnesotans sit down to work it all out?&nbsp; 
    Appendix&nbsp; K (&quot;40 Models of Communications&quot;) and Appendix 
    L (&quot;14 Models of Conflict Resolution for use in Institutional or 
    Wider Area Stakeholder Process to Bring&nbsp; Resolution and Consensus&quot;) 
    are two sections of empirically proven methods for successfully resolving 
    the issues faced by all four entities (and for those with a need for better/civil 
    interpersonal communications styles to make such discussions successful, 
    some are listed in Appendix M (&quot;Table of Contents, 'Lists and Recipes 
    for Success', featuring management as coaching and leading, not dictating 
    and coercing, for goal setting/achieving, and overcoming adversity to 
    succeed (use with Appendices K &amp; L)&quot;. </p>
  <p>MN Vikings:&nbsp; the new owner, Red McCombs, is correct:&nbsp; the Metrodome 
    is now obsolete, just as the former owners also said, but could not solve 
    the problem, so they sold the team.&nbsp; No local person bought it as 
    they knew the former owners and all believed the same thing.&nbsp; They 
    still need a new stadium.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie Walters, in the 5-24-01 
    Pioneer Press, points out the gamble in the rumor that he repeats that 
    if the Vikings are not&nbsp; provided a new stadium,&nbsp; they will&nbsp; 
    move to L.A., following the Minneapolis Lakers (note:&nbsp; the next day 
    he repeats the rumor that Red will sell locally to someone who can get 
    the stadium).&nbsp;&nbsp; The NFL wants the Vikings in Minnesota.&nbsp; 
    And certainly the NFL wants a team in L.A.&nbsp; And certainly the Vikings 
    and Saints, without modern stadium, seem likely candidates.&nbsp; But 
    the NFL's integrity would be on the line, given their assurances the Vikings 
    would not be moved.&nbsp; That leaves the Saints or an expansion club.&nbsp; 
    But the sizeable revenues for the league from L.A. are currently lost.&nbsp; 
    The NFL won't wait long. The Model discussed here would enable the Vikings 
    to solve their stadium problem in Minnesota and provides the NFL with 
    a new paradigm for more easily establishing an expansion club.</p>
  <p>MN Twins:&nbsp; Carl Pohlad has resisted the foolish economics of many 
    teams by refusing to go into debt to secure new players.&nbsp; Because 
    the team remains economically sound, it is in an excellent position to 
    adapt to the new realities.&nbsp; Also, it sometimes snows in October.&nbsp; 
    It only makes sense for Minnesota to have a retractable roof.&nbsp; Contraction 
    won't happen.&nbsp; Its too costly.&nbsp; And it turns down the revenues 
    from one of the great cities and regions of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    model discussed here would solve the Twins' problems.</p>
  <p>MN Gophers:&nbsp;&nbsp; a hobby of mine is teaching (and I have done 
    so at the college, university, and business school levels, including in 
    Minnesota).&nbsp; Universities are single minded and jealous of their 
    independence.&nbsp; Does anyone really think the University of Minnesota 
    is going to want 60,000 people tramping across its campus several times 
    a week all year to share a stadium with the outside world?&nbsp; Or share 
    its autonomy with a business entity?&nbsp; And yet, as Appendix A of the 
    Model points out, universities across the country are obtaining new and 
    bigger stadiums, some with state help, a lot with alumni support.&nbsp; 
    The UM can read the papers, sees this and surely is quietly going along 
    until the shared stadium idea goes away and they make their push to get 
    their own stadium.&nbsp; The problem will be if they make the mistake 
    of making it an either/or:&nbsp; either the Gophers or the Vikings get 
    a stadium.&nbsp; The model discussed here would enable both of them&nbsp; 
    to get their desired stadiums.</p>
  <p>The Metrodome:&nbsp; what a place.&nbsp; Very impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    I've seen the Vikings (last fall), Timberwolves (their first year), and 
    Twins (earlier this month) play there.&nbsp; Its quite a place.&nbsp; 
    But from a fan point of view, it no longer works.&nbsp; I've seen baseball 
    before in the outdoors, and baseball needs sky (and a retractable roof 
    when the sky sends rain, snow, or cold).&nbsp; The Timberwolves game with 
    school kids in the rafter was worse than viewing a TV set.&nbsp; Football 
    works the best there.&nbsp; As would other activities (see Part I of the 
    Model).&nbsp; Too few restaurants.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Too few bathrooms (with an aging population growing so that there are 
    now many more people who have to go to the bathroom more&nbsp; often than 
    when it was built, the new stadiums with more bathrooms are a must).&nbsp; 
    Too narrow of passageways:&nbsp; I'm surprised kids in strollers are stomped 
    in the crowds.&nbsp; Minnesota is to be applauded for building it originally 
    with a &quot;perfect&quot; public private partnership that enabled it 
    to be paid off ahead of schedule.&nbsp; There are still many uses to which 
    the Metrodome could be put to use (as discussed in the Model) until it 
    too comes down and is replaced by a 21st century structure or complex.&nbsp; 
    Minnesota can set itself up to be applauded again:&nbsp; showing how cities 
    can fund more than one team and its stadium, and still provide for its 
    citizens as well.</p>
  <p>Minnesota needs to rephrase the question:&nbsp; ask not what the state 
    can provide for the teams but what the state and teams working together 
    can provide for the fans and communities of the Twin Cities and the state, 
    using 21 century economic paradigms as well as new kinds of private-public 
    partnerships that benefit both (for the latest regarding how many economic 
    theories still hold to rules long proved false, see &quot;The Fed's Faded 
    Glory&quot; in today's WSJ, p. A22, or read it at http://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB993513383308253517.htm 
    ).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is a delight to join you in this very important and much needed discussion.&nbsp; 
    This discussion counts.&nbsp; Hopefully it will contribute to the resolution 
    all want:&nbsp; new stadiums for their favorite teams without having to 
    do so at the expense of valid social issues like education, job training, 
    houses, city services, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sports have become the &quot;enchantment&quot; 
    vehicle of choice (see Appendix C of the Model for a discussion of this) 
    for most, and it is the one topic all can talk about at work, home, neighborhood, 
    church/synagogue/mosque and not have to worry about stepping into one 
    of a myriad of&nbsp; &quot;politically correct&quot; mine fields.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Communities love their teams.&nbsp; And if the pros don't stop harming 
    the geese that lay the golden eggs, fans will move on to soccer, Lacrosse, 
    Australian Football, and/or a whole host of other sports, and/or new TV 
    programming as well as TV from around the world that could greatly effect 
    the pro leagues/teams/owners/players.&nbsp;&nbsp; Communities are devastated 
    emotionally when their favorite players leave, and are even more so when 
    their teams are yanked (hence Baltimore heading off for Indianapolis in 
    the dead of night).&nbsp; A new paradigm or model, if you will, is needed.&nbsp; 
    We have it.&nbsp; It is attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is win-win for all.</p>
  <p>I look forward to any and all comments on our &quot;model&quot; and to 
    engaging you in discussing this most important, complex, and important 
    topic.&nbsp;&nbsp; For &quot;file&quot; purposes, I have left the two 
    attachments noted above attached to this Email.&nbsp; However, they will 
    be dropped off when forward to you.&nbsp; So, if any of you want copies 
    of the model or the piece on backlash, Email me and I will send it to 
    you.&nbsp; Email me at&nbsp; peterjj@peterjessen-gpa.com</p>
  <p>Also, I will be town again some time during the last of July and the 
    first part of August.&nbsp; If anyone wants to get together and have a 
    discussion, especially in a group format,  I would be glad to 
    join the discussion, and to answer any questions about the Model.</p>
  <p>Thank you.<br>
