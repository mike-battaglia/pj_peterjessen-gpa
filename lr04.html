  <p><b>4.&nbsp; &quot;To Do&quot; Lists and &quot;Positive Self Talk&quot; 
    as &quot;Road Maps&quot; for Overcoming Adversity and Achieving Personal 
    and Professional Leadership Success Through Empowering Self and Others</b><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Key to success in any endeavor is the level of one's perceived sense of 
    helplessness (its impossible; nothing I do will matter) as opposed to 
    a sense of optimism (this can be done; what I do matters).&nbsp; The American 
    Psychological Association states that Martin E.P. Seligman's theory of 
    &quot;learned helplessness&quot; is the &quot;Landmark Theory of the Century.&quot;&nbsp; 
    His book on how to overcome it, Learned Optimism:&nbsp; How to Change 
    Your Mind and Life, has been called &quot;one of the most important books 
    of the century.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Seligman defines &quot;learned helplessness&quot; as &quot;the giving-up 
    reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever 
    you do doesn't matter.&nbsp; Explanatory style is the manner in which 
    you habitually explain to yourself why events happen&quot; (p. 15).&nbsp; 
    Hence the importance of &quot;self talk.&quot;&nbsp; Seligman goes on:&nbsp; 
    &quot;An optimistic explanatory style stops helplessness, whereas a pessimistic 
    explanatory style&nbsp; spreads helplessness&quot; (p. 16).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    This is about what Schuller calls &quot;possibility thinking&quot;, which 
    is a step beyond Peale's &quot;positive thinking.&quot;&nbsp; Seligman 
    again:&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Learned optimism is not a rediscovery of the &quot;power of positive&quot; 
      thinking.'&nbsp; The skills of optimism&#133;do not consist in learning 
      to say positive things to yourself.&nbsp; We have found over the years 
      that positive statements you make to yourself have little if any effect.&nbsp; 
      What is crucial is what you think when you fail, using the power of 
      'non-negative thinking.&quot;&nbsp; Changing the destructive things 
      you say to yourself when you experience the setbacks that life deals 
      all of us is the central skill of optimism.&nbsp; (emphasis added)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&#147;Lists and recipes&#148; are all about how to change destructive 
    thinking through &quot;self talk&quot;.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The &quot;clue concepts&quot; here are learning and theatre.&nbsp; We 
    can influence a great deal, on our own, as the dramatists or playwrights 
    of our own lives, and change the scripts of helplessness we have been 
    given and lived with.&nbsp; &nbsp;Learned helplessness.&nbsp; Learned 
    optimism.&nbsp; The &quot;Q's&quot; have a lot to do with this:&nbsp; 
    quotients:&nbsp;&nbsp; IQ, EQ, AQ (Intelligence quotient, emotional quotient, 
    and adversity quotient).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Three recent book titles tell us what we need to know about the &quot;Q's&quot;, 
    and help us to better answer the question &quot;How well am I handling 
    the &quot;Q's&quot;?&nbsp; How can I learn to handle them better?&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Emotional Intelligence: Why it can matter more than IQ, by Daniel Goleman, 
    discusses EQ , which we can control and improve.&nbsp; Outsmarting IQ, 
    by David Perkins, suggests, paraphrasing Sandra Scarr, that &quot;opportunity 
    breeds predestination&quot;.&nbsp; How does one take advantage of opportunity?&nbsp; 
    Be believing he or she can.&nbsp; Hence:&nbsp; Adversity Quotient:&nbsp; 
    Turning Obstacles Into Opportunities, by Paul G. Stoltz, which deals with 
    AQ. &nbsp;AQ is also something the individual can control and improve.&nbsp; 
    Note that IQ (intelligence quotient), is considered the least important 
    Q for success of however many &quot;Q's&quot; are out there.&nbsp; This 
    is poignantly seen in this quote from Calvin Coolidge:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence.&nbsp; Talent 
      will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent.&nbsp; 
      Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.&nbsp; Education 
      will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.&nbsp; Persistence 
      and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan &quot;press on&quot; 
      has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The resolve behind persistence comes from learned optimism and positive 
    self-talk.&nbsp; <br>
    Handle the &quot;Q's&quot; by (1) adding business knowledge and self understanding 
    through Stoltz's <br>
    CO2RE and others, (2) by considering weekly the &quot;Ben Franklin 13&quot;, 
    and (3) by &quot;staying the course&quot; with Napoleon Hill's Think and 
    Grow Rich's &quot;6 ways to turn desires into gold&quot; (p. 36), by following 
    his &quot;13 action steps to success&quot; by overcoming &quot;the 6 fears&quot; 
    (p. 222), &amp; by avoiding the &quot;31 major reasons or causes of failure&quot; 
    (pp. 120-126)?<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    In his book Adversity Quotient:&nbsp; Turning Obstacles into Opportunities, 
    Paul G. Stoltz builds upon Seligman as well as 500 studies since then. 
    Stoltz demonstrates of how results can be obtained instantly and that, 
    with practice, made permanent.&nbsp; His &quot;recipes&quot; are clear, 
    and are repeated below in Section 16:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; List of 3 stages, p. 285-287:&nbsp; (1) Dreaming 
      the Dream (higher AQs allow imaging of greater possibilities); (2) Making 
      the Dream the Vision (higher AQs take action on the dream, recognizing 
      the need to separate out the possible realties and sacrifices and then 
      work accordingly; and (3) Sustaining the Vision (able to continue the 
      ascent of the climb without being distracted or taken off the path; 
      higher AQs are fueled by the relentless effort required to forge ahead.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; List of 15 levels of profiles reflecting AQ 
      from low to high, pp. 128-137.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; List of 22 ways to destroy your follower's 
      AQs, pp. 260-263<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; List of 44 ways to boost your follower's AQs, 
      pp. 264-273<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp; List of 5 distracters and three reframers 
      for interrupting destructive personal responses so that you can alter 
      your emotional and physical state to put you on the climb back to a 
      higher AQ (another form of &quot;self talk,&quot; of &quot;as a man 
      thinketh, so is he&quot;).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In his chapter 5, Stoltz lists AQ profiles reflecting 15 levels of AQ.&nbsp; 
    His presentation is summed up in CO2RE (control, origin and ownership, 
    reach, endurance).&nbsp; He urges the use of lists to gain control over 
    adversity, gain appropriate perspective on the adversity, including taking 
    the appropriate responsibility, and see the light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; 
    In this way, the origins of the adversity can be better perceived/understood/interpreted, 
    to better enable one to take ownership of one's own responsibility in 
    getting there and for getting out, in order to reduce the reach (extent) 
    of its influence, and thus reduce its endurance.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Stoltz concludes his book with Chapter 10, on how to create and lead a 
    high AQ climbing culture, as one leads one's followers from unconscious 
    incompetence to conscious incompetence to conscious competence to the 
    ultimate:&nbsp; unconscious competence.&nbsp; Indeed, it could be combined 
    with Covey's concept of the &quot;Habit 5-6-7 Culture.&quot;&nbsp; And 
    although getting &quot;pumped up&quot; and &quot;energized&quot; by any 
    of the motivational practitioners of the $24 billion motivational industry 
    is wonderful at the time, the problem is that once the &quot;post-group 
    euphoria&quot; recedes, the motivation to make changes in one's life quickly 
    dies.&nbsp; Being momentary they get &quot;pumped up&quot; but then become 
    motivationally dismantled and give up, without the &quot;addicts&quot; 
    &quot;hit&quot; of another presentation.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    A safer path is to work towards a higher AQ, following &quot;The Science 
    of AQ&quot; (Chapter 3), developing a climber's habit of moving through 
    hopelessness and helplessness to sustaining a vision that leads to helpfulness 
    and hopefulness.&nbsp; Character counts (p. 32).&nbsp; This &quot;new 
    conceptual framework for understanding and enhancing all facets of success&quot; 
    is discussed in more detail in Section 16.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Thus:&nbsp; to achieve personal and professional success, we need to have 
    a plan, set the goals needed to meet the plan, and then develop the &quot;to 
    do's&quot; of the routines and scripts for our different roles and, where 
    appropriate, practice them.&nbsp; We need to empower ourselves by realizing 
    we not only can make choices but that we must make choices.&nbsp; The 
    same in true in working for others:&nbsp; to empower them is to enable 
    them to realize they have a choice, and that the choice is theirs.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The key is to work together to create common understanding and engage 
    in a negotiation that enables both &quot;sides&quot; to choose what will 
    best enable them to meet their goals, as well as negotiating with our 
    own inner self to get the best possible performance and goal reaching 
    for ourselves.&nbsp; The key is to set goals and to use the goals to set 
    plans, and to then work the plans.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Critical to this is to now make &quot;to do&quot; lists.&nbsp; Write them 
    out and check them at night and in the morning, and act on them in between.&nbsp; 
    Recite them to yourself.&nbsp; Self-talk them to yourself, so as to prevent 
    distractions from sabotaging your efforts and keeping you from taking 
    actions that reflect a plan aimed at meeting your goals.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Think of these lists as road maps, just as marathon runners follow a road 
    map for their runs.&nbsp; This is what runners do to prepare for their 
    runs.&nbsp; This entails taking steps forward, taking action, and making 
    strides, in order to turn the map into reality.&nbsp; The successful ones 
    also &quot;talk to themselves&quot; about what they are doing and how 
    they will win.&nbsp; So must all of us.&nbsp; We have to develop a new 
    role for ourselves, the role of runner, and develop routines to maintain 
    that role, routines dealing with daily exercise, sleep, diet, etc.&nbsp; 
    To keep our routines it helps to make lists.&nbsp; This is the same for 
    all of us.&nbsp; Thus, think of these lists as recipes, recipes to follow 
    to &quot;bake&quot; whatever cakes of life you have in mind for yourself.&nbsp; 
    The key to developing the best recipe/steps that work for you is to define 
    your roles and then develop the routines to practice daily to maintain 
    them.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Use these lists to set goals and to evaluate how well you are doing in 
    meeting your goals.&nbsp; To make it easier, break your goals down into 
    objectives.&nbsp; Then break these down into procedures, with time targets.&nbsp; 
    These are your steps/recipes to take/follow, your &quot;lists&quot; of 
    &quot;To Do's.&#148;&nbsp; List the schedule for doing so; list the resources, 
    people, and time you need.&nbsp; Then commit to your lists.&nbsp; Every 
    day review your lists and then make a new one for the next day.&nbsp; 
    These are your steps for the day.&nbsp; At the end of each month review 
    for positive patterns/habits you want to refine and patterns/habits you 
    want to change or eliminate.&nbsp; Redefine your roles/routines for meeting 
    your goals.&nbsp; Use the &quot;self-talk&quot; of <a href="lr11.html">section 
      11</a> below to keep you mentally and physically at your most optimistic 
    best.</p>
