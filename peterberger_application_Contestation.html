      <h2><strong>ApPlication of Peter Berger</strong></h2>
    <p>Key Principles of Peter L. Berger:&nbsp;Vis a Vis Sociology of and the  Sociology of Knowledge as they Relate to Social Roles, Social Stratification, Social  Inequality, and Justice, Peter J. Jessen, Reader, 1993</p>
    <h3> Getting results from&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;a&nbsp;&ldquo;contestation&rdquo;&nbsp;between  competing public policy idea sets</strong></h3>
    <p> <strong>EXCERPTS&nbsp;FROM:  &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/44GuideForPlanning.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Solution Paper #44, posted May 21, 2011,&nbsp;Guidelines  for Including Justice in Planning Meetings</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to Calculate a Better Future  for Minneapolis in terms of education, jobs, housing and public safety</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>by engaging in  a&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;contestation&rdquo;&nbsp;between competing public policy idea sets.</strong></p>
    <p> <strong>How do we get there? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <strong>Do we follow the modern  response of tolerance that comes with pluralism or the intolerance that comes  from one or more of the singular fundamentalisms, be it political or religious?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pluralism, the rule of the West, is  under attack from the East, especially from Islam, because they have no concept  of pluralism; thus, they can&rsquo;t think in terms of tolerance or more than one  road to the truth of the transcendent, believing steadfastly that their way is  the only way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In their mindset, they are willing to  self-destruct as martyrs, en masse, if need be, in the attempt to eliminate  us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>They  not only want to push Israel into the sea; they want to push us there as  well.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;They can do no other.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;<strong>their doctrine of&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Taqlid,</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;that no truth exists beyond  that of revealed in the Koran, means that they either have to continue until  they self destruct or until they are saved the way the Roman Catholic church  was saved, with a Reformation</strong>&nbsp;(which then impacted back  upon the Roman Catholic Church with&nbsp;<strong>the  counter-reformation, leading, in another unintended consequence, to most of the  changes Martin Luther championed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p> <strong>It is the reverse in  Minneapolis:&nbsp; the&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Taqlid</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;is  about the White Way, as it is the inner city Blacks, especially the young Black  men, who are singled out for martyrdom by White policies and practices that  deny them the access and opportunity to move up and support themselves and  their families and communities.&nbsp; This is the fundamentalism of White  racism.</strong></p>
    <p> Yet I still have hope.&nbsp; For what  could me more awesome than coming into contact with other ways.&nbsp; And so,  by seeing the other ways, we are confronted with the greatest and worst part of  being modern:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>choice</strong>.&nbsp;  Indeed, the word comes from the Greek verb&nbsp;<em>hairein,</em>&nbsp;from which we get our word&nbsp;<strong>heresy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Those  who claim that the choices of others are heresy make a claim of  truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>So,  whose truth?&nbsp; We can choose to follow the radical, murderous, intolerant  and exclusive versions of our favorite&nbsp;<u>historically specific</u>&nbsp;religion/ideology/political/  truth system, or we can chose to follow the&nbsp;<u>historically non-specific</u>&nbsp;path  of tolerance and inclusion, using a calculus of meaning and a calculus of pain  to resolve the contests between the different world views before us from which  we can choose.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Capitalism and democracy are a choice for the  historically non-specific.&nbsp; Others are a choice of the historically  specific.</strong>&nbsp; And so, dear reader, what have you  chosen?&nbsp; And if you haven&rsquo;t chosen, what will you choose?</p>
    <p> <strong>We act in bad faith when we  say we were born into hatred or a sense of superiority over others.&nbsp; We  learned it.</strong>&nbsp; And thus at some point we have to face the reality that  we know the difference and that where we stand is based on our  choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>By  what standard do we justify our choices if they have resulted in continued  impoverishment of the poor and continued poor education for Blacks and other  minorities?&nbsp; How do we justify our choices in light of these outcomes?</strong>&nbsp;  How do we stand on the debate between individuals being sovereign or a people  being sovereign, a question phrased this way in the New York Times on August 4,  2002, by Al Gore:&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <strong>There has always been a  debate over the destiny of this nation between those who believed they were  entitled to govern because of their station in life, and those who believed  that the people were sovereign. That distinction remains as strong as ever  today</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> These are good words.&nbsp; We should all  adhere to them.&nbsp; And thus each November (and in the primaries preceding  them) we are all faced with a choice when we vote for candidates for public  office.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>My  choice is to vote for those who would devolve political power to the community  so it can better achieve the YESes and turn back the NOs as the instruments of  federal and state policy so that, continuing from the above speech by Al Gore,</strong>&nbsp;[<strong>federal and state and city policy]  are &ldquo;used for the benefit of the many, rather than the few.&rdquo;</strong>  </p>
