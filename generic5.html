<p><b>1<a name="1"></a>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.&nbsp; ON-GOING TEAM 
    OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF PLAYER COMPENSATION</b></p>
<p>111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; DIRECTLY RELATED TO PLAYER COMPENSATION<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  112&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the traditional model from employer/employee or 
  management/union to team/senior executives. &nbsp;Any in corporate America 
  in this rarefied atmosphere are in a different category.&nbsp; Players 
  need to be placed between the owners/coaches &#147;above&#148; them and 
  the various staff and other operational positions, etc., which would be 
  &#147;below&#148; them.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp; This follows practices common in American business, and is used 
  as lures by executive recruiters.&nbsp; Its also common practice for the 
  team of executives to interact, even while maintaining enough separateness 
  so as to not micro manage.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; GE&#146;s Jack Welch&#146;s genius was to turn 
  his managers loose and leave most of the day to day to them, although 
  he set policy and met with them regarding strategies, unlike the parallel 
  roles played by club owners such as Jerry Jones and Daniel Snyder, who 
  are constantly interfering with their coaches or operations executives.&nbsp; 
  As the old saying goes, you can&#146;t have a business if you don&#146;t 
  run it like a business.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  114&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are multiple owners, they would serve as part 
  of the Board of Directors, along with others who are not owners (investors, 
  others appointed by the owners), which would hire a Chairman, CEO, and 
  COO (one or more of which may or may not be an owner).&nbsp; The team 
  would be run like a business.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  NOTE:&nbsp; This avoids the kind of stalemating that has occurred with 
  multiple owners, as seen in the case of the Devil Ray owners of MLB.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  115&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  4.&nbsp; This model is recommended as the best way to maximize profits, 
  maintain cost containment, and offer the fan an experience that will not 
  be prohibitive due to cost, which would drive fans to other sports.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  116&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  5.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get players to agree to this new model, first explain 
  to them that they need to do more than just work for money; they need 
  to make their money work for them, and then, secondly, show them how to 
  make their money work for them by combining the two traditional salary 
  categories and, then following the patterns of corporate America, add 
  10 new salary categories, 2 of which are non-tangible, non-material, which 
  will make their money work for them.&nbsp; This makes a total of 12 categories.&nbsp; 
  The 12 salary categories are: <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Signing Bonuses<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Unconditional:&nbsp; to offer players in exchange for the rest of the 
  package:&nbsp; a graduated scale, with both a specified low and high, 
  with the eventual amount to be negotiated with each player.&nbsp; Seek 
  a league wide scale.&nbsp; Pay less than mega amounts current today.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Salary Cap:&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Unconditional:&nbsp; maintain current system with whatever changes are 
  negotiated.&nbsp; Establish with &#147;union&#148; a league wide &#147;minimum 
  wage&#148; or floor (by all or by position).<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Golden Handcuffs (Stay For Minimum Amount Of Years To Vest In Retirement 
  Plan)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Conditional:&nbsp; a separate, potential income pool, with contributions 
  made by team, which could be options in a separate tracking stock or a 
  bonus or set of bonuses, to be paid at given out years.&nbsp; Forfeited 
  if voluntarily leaves for another team.&nbsp; Not forfeited if cut or 
  involuntarily traded.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  .Golden Parachutes (1-2 Year &#147;Severance Pay&#148; If Receive Play 
  Ending Injury, any time, or Are &#147;Cut&#148; after four years)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Conditional:&nbsp; a separate income pool, to be received if the player 
  receives a career ending injury or is let go of by the team.&nbsp; Forfeited 
  if players leave for another team before four years.&nbsp; For career 
  end or career ending injury, package includes career transition consulting 
  and support.&nbsp; This helps to reduce upfront signing bonuses.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Participation In Profit Pool (As Consulting Firm Partners And Law Firm 
  Partners Do)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Conditional:&nbsp; team profits are placed into a separate pool, with 
  specified percentages for the investors, the owner(s), the coaches, and 
  the players, with the latter two percentages based on incentive contributions 
  and years of playing for the team.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Player stock option pool: current discussions in various cities often 
  overlook one of the easiest ways to finance debt and pay off the stadium:&nbsp; 
  structure levels of stocks and options that would give to players a piece 
  of the team later on when such options would be exercised, because with 
  a new stadium, the team will be worth many millions more, which will happen 
  regardless of whether the owners wish to sell or not.&nbsp; Adding players 
  to the financial picture helps both:&nbsp; lower salaries and signing 
  bonuses, with any difference put into the stadium, which could be publicly 
  or privately owned and have publicly traded non-voting stock, with the 
  players getting options which will be worth significantly more later on.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  ESOP's:&nbsp; another option is to use Employee Stock Option Plans as 
  invented by Louis Kelso and used in many corporations.&nbsp; This would 
  reduce the need for as much up front dollars and provide back end dollars 
  for athletes.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  124&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Retirement Plans<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Conditional:&nbsp; contributions from both players and team, to begin 
  at dates complimentary to retirement plan law; requires specified time 
  period to vest (3-5 years); amount is lost if voluntarily leave under 
  free agency auspices.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Personal Affairs Assistance And/Or Management.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Conditional:&nbsp; financial planning, with bookkeeper to pay bills and 
  other areas to cover not handled by agent; assistance in planning post- 
  professional future after playing days.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tangible 
  and Intangible &#147;Perks&#148;:&nbsp; Special Events For Players And/Or 
  Families (Spouse And/Or Kids) <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Unconditional:&nbsp; &#147;intangible&#148; includes such events as the 
  annual cookout during Training Camp; holiday celebrations within two weeks 
  after the team&#146;s last game of the season.&nbsp; A &#147;player social 
  handbook&#148; listing all of the organizations that meet player interest, 
  compiled after surveying team, on their interests, like and dislikes, 
  and desire parts of their &#147;new beginnings,&#148; for both married 
  and single.&nbsp; Provide an environment that emphasizes the positive 
  side of life and living, love, and relationships.&nbsp; Included in the 
  intangible is the inclusion of a higher percentage of Black coaches and 
  Black office/support staff.&nbsp; As reported in USA Today, December 11, 
  2000, p. 2C, quoting Chris Colinsworth:&nbsp; &#147;The fact that you 
  only have three African-American coaches in the league really shows how 
  far removed these white owners are from their predominantly African-American 
  locker rooms.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Tangible&#148; includes specific 
  revenue generating projects.&nbsp; One such project could be an exercise 
  video/DVD, starring players and coaches' wives and daughters, as well 
  as wives and daughters of key friends of the team.&nbsp; The members of 
  the family would share in the profits.&nbsp; They could designate a portion 
  to a favorite charity of the team in the community.&nbsp; We have a complete 
  program and proposal for doing so as well. A second one is to provide 
  writers to write the autobiography of any player wishing to have one written.&nbsp; 
  We can also provide that A third is to provide an identification web site 
  for the player, on which is the player&#146;s record, stats, pictures, 
  etc.,, as well as items for sale, including autobiography and memorabilia, 
  with links to companies with which the players has endorsements.&nbsp; 
  Net Intrust can provide that.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal 
  Recruitment<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Unconditional:&nbsp; Provide FYI packets for players:&nbsp;&nbsp; covers 
  all of the above, which serve to continually &#147;recruit&#148; the player 
  for staying with the team as long as the team desires them, to add to 
  the above to make them feel special, even if the team feels it is in the 
  team&#146;s best interest to trade or release a player.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &#149;&nbsp; Special off-season breakfast or lunch or dinner as a team<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &#149;&nbsp; Regular special C.O.AC.H. inspirational breakfasts (weekly 
  or bi-weekly).&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &#149;&nbsp; Pre-season &#147;kick-off&#148; for players and families 
  hosted by the owner, plus one at mid-season and post-season.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &#149;&nbsp; A luxury box suite for their families at home games (note:&nbsp; 
  even at Supreme Court sessions, a front row is reserved for the spouses 
  of the Justices). <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Newsletter 
  Reporting<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Unconditional: &nbsp;provide comparisons of current or past negative and 
  positive experiences of players who put themselves up for free agency 
  (players who wind up earning less), and financial status at career&#146;s 
  end (the number that go bankrupt, and have not prepared for post-playing 
  days life).&nbsp; Use a calibration showing what has happened to other 
  players:&nbsp; exposure to not coming back, not getting as much, playing 
  on a worse team, causing stars and non-stars to earn less, worse environment 
  for family, and a coach or system that doesn&#146;t take advantage of 
  their skills, etc.&nbsp; Each departed player could be diagramed in that 
  way.&nbsp; Also:&nbsp; baseball a couple of years ago saw many free agents 
  drop from significant 7 figures to low and middle 6 figures.&nbsp; Outline 
  both tangible and intangible reasons for staying.&nbsp; Salaries can&#146;t 
  continue to increase at the front end.&nbsp; The trend will eventually 
  kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.&nbsp; Players wanting more money 
  for ego reasons, be it to be highest position player or highest player 
  of all, poisons the goose, is not in the best interest of the business, 
  makes for poor entertainment, drops in TV ratings, fans leaving for other 
  sports, etc.&nbsp; Players as partners would be paid on a partnership 
  basis:&nbsp; as a percentage of profits, fluctuating with the market based 
  on their performance which often determines whether fans will buy tickets 
  or watch on TV. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  129&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two old movies give us two famous song questions:&nbsp; 
  &#147;What&#146;s it all about?&#148; and &#147;Is that all there is?&#148;&nbsp; 
  This Compensation Package Plan helps players transcend the dollars to 
  find meaning in all of the adulation and attention they will receive in 
  order to put it in perspective such that it becomes a source of power 
  to achieve good and not just a distraction nor a road to some kind of 
  personal destruction.&nbsp; And with the 12 part compensation package, 
  players and owners can better exercise stewardship of their responsibilities, 
  the first of which is to the game, and then to their fans, their team, 
  and then to themselves.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom line: &nbsp;it&#146;s about league/team/individual 
  survival. &nbsp;The key to survival:&nbsp; the Fan</p>
