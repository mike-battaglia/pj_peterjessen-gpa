      <h2><strong>ApPlication of Peter Berger</strong></h2>
    <p>Key Principles of Peter L. Berger:&nbsp;Vis a Vis Sociology of and the  Sociology of Knowledge as they Relate to Social Roles, Social Stratification, Social  Inequality, and Justice, Peter J. Jessen, Reader, 1993</p>
        <h3><strong>From &ldquo;The Valley of the Fallen&rdquo; To The  &ldquo;Mountain of the Risen</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>FROM:  &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/44GuideForPlanning.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Solution  Paper #44, posted May 21, 2011,&nbsp;Guidelines for Including Justice in  Planning Meetings</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to Calculate a Better  Future for Minneapolis in terms of education, jobs, housing and public safety</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>by engaging in  a&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;contestation&rdquo;&nbsp;between competing public policy idea sets.</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>Excerpt:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Calculating A Better Future  For All,&nbsp;</strong><strong>p. 297-299</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of Interlude 16, of <em>The  Minneapolis Story</em></strong></p>
        <p> <strong>From  &ldquo;The Valley of the Fallen&rdquo; To The &ldquo;Mountain of the Risen:&rdquo;</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>A Parable of  Calculating Actions and Laws</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>For Their Attendant  Pain and Meaning,</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>To Better Envision A  World Integrating All People</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>into the Mainstream of  Equal Access and Equal Opportunity</strong></p>
        <p> I believe our new, smaller government  must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens  through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable  and civic associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the  most of their own lives -- with stronger families, more educational  opportunity, economic security , safer streets, a cleaner environment in a  safer world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> President Bill Clinton, State of the  Union Message, 1996&nbsp;</p>
        <p> The era of big government is over. But we  cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.  We must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the  challenges together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we  must have both.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> From&nbsp;<em>Pyramids of Sacrifice:&nbsp; Political Ethics and  Social Change</em>&nbsp;(Basic Books, NY, NY, 1974), Peter L. Berger:</p>
        <p> Thesis #11:&nbsp; We must seek solutions  to our problems that accept&nbsp;<em>neither</em>&nbsp;hunger&nbsp;<em>nor terror.</em></p>
        <p> Thesis #15:&nbsp; Those who are the objects of policy should have the&nbsp;</p>
        <p> opportunity to participate not only in specific decisions but in the  definitions of the situation on which these decisions are based.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Thesis #22:&nbsp; A key area for such institutional innovation will be in  the&nbsp;</p>
        <p> creation of&nbsp;<em><strong>intermediate  structures</strong></em>â€”intermediate, that is, between the modern state and  the undifferentiated mass of uprooted individuals typical of modern  societies.&nbsp; This policy imperative cuts across the capitalist/socialist  dichotomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Peter Berger ends his 1972 book&nbsp;<u>Pyramids  of Sacrifice:&nbsp; Political Ethics and Social Change</u>&nbsp;with the story  of the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp; It was filled with moral ambiguity and  unspeakable brutality on both sides, with the Nationalists, the&nbsp;<em>Falange</em>, attempting to  &ldquo;hold at bay the forces of modernity, to turn Spain back to the virtues of an  earlier age,&rdquo; as they fought against the Republican ideals of modern democracy  and revolutionary salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Both  were &ldquo;historically specific conservatives.&rdquo;</strong></p>
        <p> Spain&rsquo;s monument to this conflict, near the Valley of the Fallen, was dug out  of a mountain, where thousands from both sides are buried, with the  inscription:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;to  die for God and Spain.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp; Berger&rsquo;s chilling statement  is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>And the  Spain that is now emerging has nothing to do with what either side fought and  died for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em>This can be said also about the Civil  Rights movement as it applies to Blacks in the inner city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Few historical actions lead  to intended consequences, whereas many lead to unintended consequences.</strong>&nbsp;  So good intentions are not enough.&nbsp; We need&nbsp;<strong>a way to evaluate both our policies</strong>&nbsp;and  our deeds.&nbsp; I have suggested one approach with my&nbsp;<strong>YESes and NOs of Chapters 5</strong>&nbsp;that  are&nbsp;<strong>repeated in  Chapter 17.</strong></p>
        <p> Since then, Berger has developed another  way of helping us understand social dynamics by&nbsp;<strong>casting aside the model of Left and  Right, Liberal and Conservative</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>He notes how we are all  conservative, in that once we get our way, we want to keep it that way.</strong>&nbsp;  In other words, the basic difference between political Left and Right is in  what they want to conserve.&nbsp; For those on the political far Left, the  ideal is an imagined utopian future that they want to put in place, often  through revolutionary means, and once established, conserve it by freezing it  in place, and accept no more change.&nbsp; The model usually includes some  component of socialism.&nbsp; This, in my view, is the essence of the  20th-century&rsquo;s socialist totalitarian societies.&nbsp; For those on the  political Right, the ideal is an imagined golden age that they wish to  resurrect from the past, often through armed means, and once established,  conserve it and freeze it in place, and accept no more change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Both are &ldquo;historically&nbsp;<u>specific</u>&nbsp;conservatives.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>An alternative is what Berger calls  &ldquo;historically nonspecific conservatives,</u></strong>&rdquo; those who  recognize that&nbsp;<strong>no  matter what one tries to freeze in place, there will still be change, both  unpredicted and unintended, and therefore one need &ldquo;make haste slowly.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;  He discusses this in his 1991 essay &ldquo;Capitalism and the Disorders of  Modernity,&rdquo; in the journal&nbsp;<em>First  Things.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>One  way to tell the difference is to ask if anyone is being asked to be saddled or  assumed to be naturally saddled, and are others saying they were born to ride  them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> If we agree that no solution should be  accepted that accepts hunger or terror, and that&nbsp;<strong>those who must live under policies  should have the opportunity to participate in the policy decisions,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>especially in intermediate  institutions of community, neighborhoods, churches, and voluntary organizations</strong>,  then we must include an acceptance of the phrase &ldquo;preferential option for the  poor,&rdquo; especially in terms of&nbsp;<strong>education,  jobs, and housing.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p> To integrate everyone into the social and political mainstream means they have  to have equal access and opportunity in the economic mainstream.&nbsp; Many  theories have been proposed for how to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Only one system has proven to bring  more people out of poverty than any other:&nbsp; capitalism, a market economy,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and only one system has proven to  offer more freedom and liberty than any other:&nbsp; democracy, with its  emphasis on equal law and private property.&nbsp; Some might call it&nbsp;<u>democratic  capitalism</u>&nbsp;(because dictatorships also use capitalism).</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;In other words, you can have  capitalism without democracy, but you cannot have democracy without  capitalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Many think the Scandinavian countries  are socialist.&nbsp; They are not.&nbsp; Their socialist-style welfare programs  have been supported by economies that are capitalist.</p>
        <p> Throughout, I have held that&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;equal opportunity&rdquo; does&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;mean  &ldquo;equal results</strong>.&nbsp; That is foolish.&nbsp; Many think&nbsp;<strong>Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;worst  deed was the Vietnam War.&nbsp; Certainly I was no fan of the war.&nbsp; It may  not have been necessary.&nbsp; It surely wasn&rsquo;t executed right. But as  Gorbachev later said it helped bankrupt the Soviet Union, we may have to  begrudgingly admit it helped end the Cold War.&nbsp; And his Great Society was  well intended (we were all in favor of ending poverty even as we disagreed on  the means to do so).&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>His  worst deed was how he defined the goal of the Great Society.&nbsp; The reason  the Republicans were so horrified by the Great Society is because they  correctly interpreted his Left, Socialist goal as being unintentionally  totalitarian.&nbsp; The goal, as LBJ stated it, was:&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>not just equality as a right  and a theory but equality as a fact and as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>To achieve &ldquo;equality of  result&rdquo; in terms of equal access and equal opportunity is one thing.&nbsp; To  expect, as many on the Left pushed for, equal results and the redistribution of  property and wealth, would require absolute state coercion at every level,  including the redistribution of private property, and telling everyone what  they could become in society, as if they were potted plants to place in a  socially engineered garden, which is the opposite of what most of us mean by  freedom and liberty.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p> Here is where the Democrats really went  wrong, set an impossible goal, and caused many needless debates, not to mention  programs doomed before they started.&nbsp; It is a beautiful, poetic statement  albeit a wrong and deadly one.&nbsp; I still wonder today if Johnson really  understood it or if it was just another of the many speeches he saw for the  first time when he read it.&nbsp; We all know that human beings are, by nature,  unequal, whether we are playing in the Super Bowl or on Jeopardy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What I have been talking about is  that Blacks haven&rsquo;t been allowed to participate in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p> <strong>Equality of result is  decidedly not what I mean.</strong>&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t think LBJ  did either.&nbsp; But many programs since then have been run as if they can  have equal results.&nbsp; To me,&nbsp;<strong>equal  results can only be understood&nbsp;<u>in terms of equal access and equal  opportunity</u>&nbsp;in education, jobs, affordable housing, and the option to  participate in the social, political and economic opportunities of our society.</strong>  </p>
