  <h3>The Stadium Problem Problem</h3>
  <p>The Unintended Consequence of a 1986 Federal Law</p>
  <p>By Peter Jessen, September 7, 2001</p>
  <p>Exerpts from and Commentary On:
    The DOW of Professional Sports, by Craig Lambert</p>
  <p>in the September-October 2001 issue of Harvard Magazine for Alumni: Article is at <a href="http://www.harvard-magazine.com/on-line/09014.html" target="_blank">http://www.harvard-magazine.com/on-line/09014.html</a></p>
  <p>(Copy sent to MN legislature, House Speaker, Steve Sviggum and Senate President Roger Moe and others: Roy Terwilliger, Larry Fitzgerald, John Marty, David Jennings, Sarah Psick, Victor Moore, Tom Hanson)  </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-right:-9.0ptü>This referenced article provides 
    more understanding regarding the <b>the stadium problem problem</b>.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The new problem is working together to make it happen despite the 
    problem caused by the federal law.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The 
    problem problem is the interference of the feds with their 1986 law..<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Nonetheless, it is still possible to craft a solution to the stadium 
    problem and the stadium problem problem.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>1.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b><b>The stadium problem problem is the unintended consequence 
    of a federal law</b> passed to eliminate public spending (micromanaging 
    through laws in a market economy with political liberty often yields such 
    unintended consequences).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-top:0in;margin-right:-4.5pt;margin-bottom: 0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001ptü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>2.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü>&nbsp; </span></b>In The DOW of Professional Sports (Harvard Magazine for Alumni, 
    September-October 2001), we learn that <b>Before 1986,</b> these municipal 
    investments produced dividends, because <b>public authorities received 
      all stadium revenues except ticket sales</b> (which included concessions 
    and parking fees).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>But a new tax 
    law that year changed this, by requiring that team owners garner 90 percent 
    of all stadium revenues.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-right:-4.5ptü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>3.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b>In other words, and lets be clear, <b>THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED 
    BY FEDERAL LAW MAKERS</b> trying to micromanage cities, NOT by owners 
    trying to micromanage cities or states.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Because building a stadium with public tax exempt bonds was cheaper 
    than using taxable private bonds, federal taxpayers, via these tax-exempt 
    bonds, had been subsidizing about a third of stadium construction costs.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>Note:</b> it was the same 1986 tax law that opened the same 
    door to the S&amp;L fiasco, another license to take advantage of the feds, 
    as they pledged to cover any gambles that didn't pay off (again, lawmakers 
    who were not businessmen or bankers, but merely attoneys who didn't understand 
    either, came up with this unintended consequence fiasco).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>4.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b><b>The false beef</b> was that States without franchises, like 
    the Dakotas, objected to paying for stadiums elsewhere.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Here again is where <b>narrow thinking missed the big picture</b>.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>T.V. enabled <b>every citizen</b> of states without franchises, <b>including the Dakotas,</b> to still see their favorite teams.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The Cowboys used to be considered America's team.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Now it is the Vikings, giving even more positive exposure for Minnesota.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>5.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b>Please note:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>The 
    Dakotas are now free riders</b>, because they still get to watch their 
    favorite teams, at their teams expense solely.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>6.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b>Interestingly enough<b>, one of the sponsors</b> of that bill 
    was an ex-pro sports person who did it:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>Senator Bill Bradley</b> (former New York Knicks player).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>That law declared that, <b>for bonds to be tax-exempt, no more 
      than 10 percent of stadium revenue could go to municipalities.</b><span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>This is what happens when people who don't understand taxes or 
    how the tax game in played in this country (going on ever since the Boston 
    Tea Party:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>learn the rules and 
    then use them in your favor to reduce your taxes; it's the #1 universal 
    American sport every April).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>7.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b><b>Bradley mistakenly believed</b> this would be a disincentive 
    for cities to underwrite stadium construction.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>But Bradley (and most of the congressional staffers who wrote the 
    bill) never had city experience or even state experience.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>He ran for Senator as a celebrity and won.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>That is not to knock his celebrity-hood, which he earned, but to 
    point out that being an expert in one area doesn't make him automatically 
    an expert in other areas where he has had no experience.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>His false assumption</b> was that no city would then use public 
    funds to build stadiums.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> </p>
  <p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops:list.5in.75inü> <b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>8.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b>Please note:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>the Feds 
    were trying to tell the cities what they could and could not spend their 
    money on.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The blame today is laid 
    at the doorstep of owners and players when, if everyone clued in on the 
    same page, the blame is the nosy feds.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>9.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b>The mystery is this:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>how 
    a guy who made his fame and fortune being a sports idol didn't understand 
    that no city wanted to lose its idols.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>The unintended consequence revealed what a mistake this law 
      was and still is</b>!<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The unintended 
    consequence was <b>to divert the public investment from the public coffers 
      into private hands</b>.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Why?<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Because owners, quite correctly, said to mayors and governors, 
    because of the new law, We've got to get 90 percent of the stadium revenues 
    to make bonds tax exempt.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>And <b>once 
      that interpretation was made, the incentive was there to turn stadiums 
      into gold minds</b> with skyboxes, club seats, naming rights, arena advertising, 
    etc.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>Add to that the great economic 
      expansion of the post 1986 period and you have this distortion of the 
      private-public partnership</b>.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>10.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b><b>FIRST:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>it is OK for 
    stadiums to be gold mines.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>SECONDLY, 
    it is OK for states and cities to now negotiate their revenues</b> <b>with 
      the teams</b>, so that the monies can be shared to enable funding the 
    stadium and provide income for the team.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>This is why they mixed use concept is viewed as best, as it 
      provides for year around revenues.</b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>11.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü>&nbsp; </span></b><b>Government guys without business experience often don't 
    understand the concept or power of incentives</b> nor the folly of passing 
    laws to disincentives.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Stadiums 
    could be self-paying, for in their current forms, they are cash cows.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>So, <b>to solve this, </b>owners and states/cities need to sit 
    down and work out the finances with this law in mind (until it is changed), 
    in order to use the tax laws and local incentives and <b>negotiate</b> <b>for the benefit of the golden triangle: </b><span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî></span><b>(1) </b>fans/tax payers, <b>(2)</b> law makers running for re-election, and <b>(3)</b> owners understandably wanting to have their business be profitable 
    and competitive (when Jerry Jones took over the Dallas Cowboys, they were 
    losing $1 million a month; but he had vision, the previous owners did 
    not, just as the Vikings current non-Minnesotan owner Red McCombs has 
    vision whereas the local ownership group before him that sold it to him 
    did not).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>By taking all of these 
    complicated factors into play, and working with experts in these areas, 
    the problem can be solved.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-top:0in;margin-right:-4.5pt;margin-bottom: 0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops:list.5in.75inü> <b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>12.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b>It is important to understand what sports-law specialist and 
    Harvard Law School professor Paul Weiler underscores (see his book Leveling 
    the Playing Field:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>How the Law 
    Can Makes Sports Better for Fans, Harvard University Press, 2000), that <b>big paychecks do not drive up ticket prices</b> (the average professional 
    baseball player's career is 4 years, and only 3.4 for professional football 
    players plus they work with a salary cap).<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The seats in the stands dwarf the number of people in seats before 
    TV sets at home and in Sports Bars.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>What 
      causes salaries to rise, says Weiler, is when revenues go up.</b><span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>As any business man would say:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Duh!<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Don' unions and workers 
    say this all the time:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>as their 
    companies are making more money they want to be paid more money.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Very simple.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Same thing 
    with teams.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Therefore the <b>law </b>needs to be changed which will enable some of the revenues to be used 
    in the payment of the stadiums.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span><b>As 
      it is, with TV revenues in ascendancy, as it is watched more and more 
      worldwide, </b>Team revenues, especially NFL shared revenues, will only 
    greatly increase.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>There is a moral 
    and economic imperative for teams and communities to work out the sharing 
    of revenue to the benefit of <b>both</b>.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style=ümargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list.5inü><b style=ümso-bidi-font-weight: normalü>13.<span style=üfont:7.0pt úTimes New Romanîü> </span></b><b>Now, lets finish with WHY the legislature, business community, 
    and team must cooperate FOR THE PEOPLE:<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>because Professional sports will not go away.</b><span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>As the Harvard alumni magazine article states, each of these sports 
    is a game worth playing.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>As financial 
    priorities shape more and more of daily life, <b>one motive for watching 
      athletes is to escape momentarily the tyranny of the dollar</b>.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Once the game begins, money, agents, publicists, endorsement contracts, 
    corporate advertising, and media coverage become largely irrelevant.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>Indeed, <b>sports may be the last refuge of pure meritocracy.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>The athletes are after perfection, and <i>only</i> perfection, 
      in what they do, says Peter Carfagna.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span>And that's what makes us want to watch them.<span style=îmso-spacerun: yesî> </span></b>And that is why fans will suffer if their teams leave, as will 
    the politicians which let them.</p>
