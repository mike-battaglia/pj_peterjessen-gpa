  <p>Email to Mn Legislature, October 31, 2001<br>
    Steve Sviggum, House Speaker<br>
    Roger D. Moe, Senate Majority Leader<br>
  <span class="tinytext">Copy to: Roy Terwilliger, Larry Fitzgerald, John<br>
    Marty, David Jennings, Otis Courtney, Victor Moore, Tom Hanson</span></p>
  <p>In the last two weeks, regarding Minnesota&#146;s teams, I&#146;ve gone 
    from EXCITED (because of the web site I was developing that would assist 
    you), to SAD (reading Weiner&#146;s book &quot;Stadium Games&quot; that 
    suggests the Vikings have been picked to kicked out of town) to MOURNFUL 
    (when I read Sid Hartman&#146;s Halloween scare story of the Twins this 
    morning which confirms the Vikings are to be gone). And if the scare doesn&#146;t 
    work, then within two years Minnesota will return to the 1950s, but this 
    time without championship teams, but with subsidized almost minor league 
    level teams: NBA, NHL, and will definitely lose the coveted designation 
    of &quot;big league.&quot; As Weiner states it in his book, Minnesota 
    will be, for a long time to come, merely bush league. </p>
  <p>MY EXCITEMENT was caused by the positive effect I felt my new web site 
    would be to help you with the Stadium study. ALL of the documents I have 
    sent to you are now online, on my web site that went on-line over the 
    weekend: www.peterjessen-gpa.com. All the documents, and even, with one 
    exception, all of the long form versions of the Appendices summarized 
    in the Generic Model (https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/generic.html 
    ) I sent to you, are there. Recall what I wrote in my August 10, 2001 
    letter to you (https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/mn.html )where I said, 
    &quot;Here is the basic idea: if the various main stakeholder groups in 
    Minnesota (teams and their owners, legislators and the jurisdictions, 
    stadiums and their managers, corporations and university, urban/suburban/rural, 
    white and black) can see that they are all partners in the sports-entertainment 
    industry, no one will lose and all will be winners. If each can help the 
    other get what they need and what they want, all will get what they need 
    and want. That is always at the heart of any great enterprise that involves 
    great institutions and individuals. The 10 models and the six attachments 
    provide the building blocks of everything that is needed to start. I thought, 
    wow! Now they can email the pieces that they find helpful, or the parts 
    of them, without having to copy and staple and mail, etc., and maybe it 
    will help them offset the conclusion of the Weiner book.</p>
  <p>MY SADNESS was caused by reading a book I picked up two weeks ago: Star 
    Tribune writer Jay Weiner&#146;s Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League 
    Greed and Bush League Boondoggles (you can read a summary at http://www.sportsjones.com/sj/226.shtml 
    ). Several Minnesota THEMES became apparent: (1) the desire of &quot;controlling&quot; 
    things of those with the fortunes to do so, (2) the &quot;parochialism&quot; 
    of clinging to a 1950&#146;s fantasy baseball view of reality, (3) a denial 
    of succession of the 1950&#146;s generation to their sons, letting them 
    have control, who I would wager would much rather attend an NFL Vikings 
    game than a MLB Twins game, (4) the pettiness of &quot;payback&quot; to 
    get even for sleights real and imagined, (5) the &quot;out of touchness&quot; 
    of believing professional baseball is the sport of choice when in reality 
    it is professional football, (6) the myopia of both the legislature and 
    the former owners, those before Red McCombs, of not wanting to see how 
    stadiums could be built for all the teams and provide unique and wonderful 
    economic stimulus and jobs for the region, as well as housing and other 
    positive contributions to Minnesota&#146;s economic well being for the 
    community, and (7) the obvious &quot;understanding&quot; in Weiner&#146;s 
    book that the Vikings have drawn the short straw, that they have to go 
    because the &quot;understanding&quot; says the Twin Cities cannot support 
    four teams (EVEN THOUGH as we speak they are doing so anyway). The book 
    makes clear that with Minneapolis subsidizing the Timberwolves arena and 
    St. Paul subsidizing the Wild arena, that makes the &quot;odd man out&quot; 
    to be the Vikings, because of the obvious &quot;hallowed sanctity&quot; 
    with which these old rich guys hold baseball, which means the Vikings 
    must be sacrificed on the altar of their 1950s dream and the altar of 
    the narrow vision that sees the cities as a &quot;three horse town&quot; 
    instead of a full team of four. The book makes it clear that the Vikings 
    have to go. It is why the former owners sold to an out of town guy and 
    why they refused to sell to the local guy. They will not get the blame. 
    They will not be the scapegoats. The new owner will. Well, by golly, I 
    thought, despite Weiner&#146;s book, there is still a chance. I&#146;ll 
    get my web site up and enjoin the battle, make a difference, and help 
    the push that enables all the teams to stay.</p>
  <p>MY MOURNING began when I read the Halloween scare story of Sid Hartman 
    in today&#146;s Star Tribune. Otis called me to alert me of the story. 
    I pulled it up and sure enough, there it was: (http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/795621.html 
    )&quot;Twins&#146; Pohlad ready for contraction,&quot; in which Sid writes 
    of tears coming to his eyes regarding the thought of Minnesota losing 
    the Twins. This is another round out of Weiner&#146;s book (see chapter 
    11). The deal is fake. It is a Halloween story, hiding the real horror: 
    the Vikings being kicked out of town because the old &quot;fathers&quot; 
    want the Twins and haven&#146;t faith enough in the Twin Cities and the 
    obvious significant growth that will be taking place. Sid&#146;s story 
    made him cry for the Twins. It made me cry for the Vikings. It is obvious 
    from Sid&#146;s article that the deal is done: Vikings go, Twins stay. 
    I just can&#146;t figure out just who all are in on this latest Twins 
    &quot;conspiracy&quot; the term Weiner uses of the one hatched in Arne 
    Carlson&#146;s Governor&#146;s office to get the legislature to fund a 
    stadium for the Twins (p. 386: &quot;What was the most galling was that 
    the state&#146;s leaders-especially Governor Carlson, his chief of staff 
    Omann, and his sports ambassador Savelkoul&#151;were coconspirators. They 
    created the atmosphere to force the legislature to vote for a stadium,&quot; 
    and again, p. 409: &quot;But the real conspiracy to stick up Minnesota&#146;s 
    voters was not hatched in a banker&#146;s tower in downtown Minneapolis&#133;. 
    No, it was born in the hallowed offices of the governor of the state of 
    Minnesota.&quot; Note what is missing in both: no mention of the Vikings. 
    That is another almost &quot;conspiracy&quot; - the &quot;conspiracy of 
    silence&quot; about the Vikings reported by local writers Kevin Seifert 
    and Larry Fitzgerald (https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/mn.html#Three). 
    Indeed, in my August 10, 2001 letter to you, I wrote that if something 
    wasn&#146;t done quickly, the scenario would unfold that the Vikings would 
    be pushed out of town, the Twins would get a renovated Metrodome, and 
    the Gophers would be the ones winding up with a new stadium. Two pieces 
    confirm this view in my mind, hence my tears for the Vikings: (1) the 
    Weiner book, and (2) today&#146;s Halloween scare piece of Sid. When Otis 
    and I submitted our proposal to the Vikings two summers ago, I was very 
    clear: there was no way the University would go along with a shared stadium. </p>
  <p>Why a scare piece? Because, in the words of a recent NYT article, one 
    of the consequences of 9/11 were these words: &quot;Public funds for new 
    ballparks for the Yankees and Mets? Fuggedaboutit.&quot; </p>
  <p>The same is true of Minnesota: public funds for the new ballparks for 
    the Twins and Vikings? Fuggedaboutit.&quot; UNLESS you can frighten everyone, 
    as Sid has done. But it is another ghost story, just like with Beaver 
    and the Twins in Weiner&#146;s book (chapter 11). And, with every other 
    corporation and industry lining up to the Congress and state legislatures 
    for handouts, support, subsidies (call them what you will) as a result 
    of 9/11, this is a chance to try to slip one more through. And then 9/11 
    will have another casualty, the Vikings. When will &quot;the powers at 
    be&quot; face what they don&#146;t want to face: their beloved Twins are 
    a baseball team in a football town.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that Jay Weiner shows in his book how often the Star 
    Tribune and Pioneer Press carry the water for the &quot;powers&quot; regarding 
    what they want, often without realizing it. Sid&#146;s article is just 
    another one of the same. The water they should be carrying is that of 
    the fans, who want the Vikings. The information, presented &quot;neutrally,&quot; 
    without taking sides, actually appears as if it has already been decided 
    that the Vikings will move, as it is never reported that anyone is doing 
    anything to prevent it nor protesting it. All the action is for the Twins.</p>
  <p>It should also be noted that the furor Weiner talks about regarding Red 
    McComb&#146;s famous &quot;Dunker&#146;s Speech&quot; on August 31, 1999, 
    was about remarks that the Vikings would not be playing in the Metrodome 
    in 5 years, because if it didn&#146;t have a new stadium by then, the 
    team could not be competitive. However, he made the same case that was 
    made by the previous owners. Indeed, the Vikings Chairman John Skoglund 
    hinted that the team would be forced to move if they didn&#146;t get a 
    new stadium in 1997 (&quot;Vikings say they can&#146;t stay under status 
    quo,&quot; Charley Walters, Pioneer Press, April 10, 1997). The arguments 
    Red made are the same arguments made by the former owners in their presentation 
    before the Sports Facilities Commission, December 19, 1996, as did NFL 
    Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in his statement before the Advisory Task 
    Force on Professional Sports in Minnesota, September 25, 1995. So this 
    is not new, and, hence, is not about Red. It is about the failure of nerve 
    of the once bold captains of industry now become timid and cautious, and 
    their sons more so, ready to sacrifice the Vikings on that altar of timidity 
    and caution. But they don&#146;t want the blame. So they sell it to an 
    outside scapegoat. </p>
  <p>A final &quot;proof&quot;: despite providing all of this information 
    to the legislature and others, NOT ONE addressee or staff person has gotten 
    back to me nor asked either Otis or me to participate, despite my sending 
    an outline of eight ways to finance the stadiums without new taxes and 
    my providing 10 models (five full private) for how to do so along with 
    their 3rd verification (https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/mn.html#Third 
    ). I therefore must conclude that the Stadium study panel is another way 
    for the legislature to stall until Red finally announces he is moving 
    the team or selling to an outsider who will move the team. Then the &quot;conspiracy&quot; 
    Weiner talks about will be complete. Everyone in a position to ensure 
    that the Vikings stay can say they &quot;tried&quot; and then will all 
    heap blame and scorn on Red, when the real villains of the piece are the 
    previous owner set who made the decision to squeeze them out and the last 
    two Governors who have acquiesced in this and the legislature which refused 
    to look at the issue in other than black and white terms.</p>
  <p>If this scare tactic doesn&#146;t work, then, when the dust settles Minnesota 
    will be right back where it was in the 1950s: a state with two lesser 
    sports, NBA, NHL, and missing the two major sports, NFL, MLB. That will 
    be the ultimate irony of a town that had one glorious burst of bold moving 
    forth in the 1950s, only to trade a half-century of progress for an upcoming 
    half-century of enmity from the fans and voters. And then the bold family 
    names that stood tall in the 1950s will be vilified throughout the 2000s 
    for their actions of running the people&#146;s team out of town, and, 
    if the situation worsens, BOTH teams. Wow! What a final family legacy 
    for all of those families to be remembered by. And what a final irony 
    for all of the sports writers who have so often scorned the Vikings rather 
    than celebrate the joy and pride the team has meant for the community, 
    will also lose, their jobs. They will have the &quot;honor&quot; of being 
    the last ones to leave the building, turning the lights off of a sports 
    era as they leave.</p>
