      <h2><strong>ApPlication of Peter Berger</strong></h2>
    <p>Key Principles of Peter L. Berger:&nbsp;Vis a Vis Sociology of and the  Sociology of Knowledge as they Relate to Social Roles, Social Stratification, Social  Inequality, and Justice, Peter J. Jessen, Reader, 1993</p>
    <h3> Using Berger&rsquo;s Policy approval vs. non-approval criteria  of&nbsp;those&nbsp;evaluated as YESes and those as NOs </h3>
    <p> Excerpts  from&nbsp;Solution  Paper #33,&nbsp; </p>
    <h3 align="center">The Positive Future Possibilities for Minneapolis:</h3>
    <h3 align="center">Envisioning the Dream, Sustaining the Vision:</h3>
    <h3 align="center">Not Asking Permission, Making No Apologies For Being Free</h3>
    <p><strong>EVALUATING THE DESIRED YESses  AND THE UNWANTED NOs:</strong></p>
    <p> <strong>Chapter 16, Interlude 16,  Chapter 17, and this Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;all open with&nbsp;<strong>propositions and theses of Peter  Berger</strong>&nbsp;which should also be part of our calculus of  deciding what public policies to advocate and support.</p>
    <p> <strong>Chapter 5&nbsp;</strong>suggests  the policies for a&nbsp;&ldquo;To Do&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>list  of YESes</strong>&nbsp;and NOs for the future that everyone can work  together to bring about. The first set of YESSES, simply put, centers on  policies that would result in positive outcomes regarding education, children,  and families:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>YES to a better quality of life       for ALL citizens</li>
      <li>YES to a better quality       education for all students; higher graduation rates for all schools</li>
      <li>YES to a first-rate health care</li>
      <li>YES to wider home ownership</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next are those policies that would result  in positive outcomes for transportation, energy, and the environment:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>YES to abundant natural       resources, including clean water and clean air</li>
      <li>YES to highways that keep up       with the increase in cars</li>
      <li>YES to energy policies that       prevent a California in Minnesota</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, these policies would result in  positive outcomes for the economy, jobs, wages, and business:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>YES to low unemployment and       wages that let full-time workers support their families</li>
      <li>YES to contractors who do business       with the City to hire minority workers (preferably all businesses, but at       least those doing business with the City).</li>
      <li>YES to business-friendly       environment</li>
      <li>YES to world-class corporate       research and world-class university research</li>
      <li>YES to rural-metro partnerships,       not needless competition</li>
      <li>YES to tax breaks for       individuals and for companies</li>
      <li>YES to a respect for property       and laws and access to both for all</li>
      <li>YES to equality of opportunity       for all races, especially in terms of education and job training</li>
      <li>YES to keeping our place among       the top five states in income per capita in the USA</li>
      <li>YES to keeping Fortune 500       Companies headquarters</li>
      <li>YES to once again earning the       &quot;Most Livable State&quot; award</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Chapter 5</strong>&nbsp;also  has a corresponding list to consider for&nbsp;<strong>our collective NOs</strong>. The first set of  NOs centers on policies that say NO to those outcomes that are negative for  education, children, and families:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>NO to only 17% of our       African-American male high school students graduating</li>
      <li>NO to 25% of 4 th graders today       being unable to read at 4 th -grade level (of which the percentage rises       to over 50% for Hispanics and over 60% for Blacks)</li>
      <li>NO to minority students being       kept in school systems where they are provided far fewer resources and       score much lower than White students. They are our friends and our       neighbors, and they too will join us as part of tomorrow's work force.       They should have the same opportunities.</li>
      <li>NO to hunger and children       living in garbage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then there are policies to say NO to that  result in negative outcomes for transportation, energy, and the environment:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>NO to highway construction that       does not keep up with the increase in cars</li>
      <li>NO to an energy policy that is       not adequate for the future</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, there are policies to say NO to  that result in negative outcomes for the economy, jobs, wages, and business:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>NO to having people work full       time for wages that won't support their families</li>
      <li>NO to 25% of our citizens not       being able to afford to own their own homes</li>
      <li>NO to companies contracting to       government agencies who don't hire minorities</li>
      <li>NO to maintaining a conflict       between rural and metro areas, and instead form partnerships</li>
      <li>NO to doing nothing to keep       companies and their jobs from leaving Minnesota</li>
      <li>NO to our taxes becoming too       high for the return we get in services</li>
      <li>NO to terror and       totalitarianism</li>
      <li>NO to not being willing to       evaluate programs for their true consequences, so that we can be prepared       to change policies that result in high pain and low meaning, whether for       individuals, schools, or companies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, let us revisit the notion of  &quot;talking the walk&quot; and &quot;walking the talk.&quot; What is the  &quot;talk&quot; to be walked? Several outlines have been suggested. Here I put  them all together.</p>
    <p> <strong>Interlude 8&nbsp;</strong>suggests  that A&nbsp;<strong>National  Commissionof Reconciliation and Reparations</strong>&nbsp;should be  established to investigate and work out the payments that would be involved for  the land and wealth stolen from Blacks. This basis for reparations is also  stated in Chapters 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, and the Preface.</p>
    <p> <strong>Chapter 9</strong>&nbsp;offers  a&nbsp;<strong>list of steps</strong>to  take&nbsp;<strong>to correct  oppression of Black people</strong>&nbsp;in going before various  official bodies, agencies, and investigations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Certainly try to get the numbers, but have  them certified; don't take their word for it.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Join with those who would unite and demand a Federal  grand jury investigation.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Present the wealth of information already  available to City Hall to let them know you know what you are talking  about.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Demand, politely or through legal injunction,  to get the city to state why they allow projects to continue that are not in  compliance.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Demand, politely or through legal injunction,  to get the city to state why they hire contractors with records of not being in  compliance.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Continue to hold public forums.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Continue to come up with plans of action to  foster success.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Continue to agree on who will carry out the  various steps of the plan and then do so.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Stop being patient with practices that have  gone on since the 1960s.  </li>
    </ul>
