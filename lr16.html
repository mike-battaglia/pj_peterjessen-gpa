  <p><b>16. Models For Conflict Resolution</b><br>
    <br>
    By Peter J. Jessen<br>
    1998-2000; last edited 7-18-01<br>
  <br>
    In 1998, the set consisted of 5 macro models.<br>
    In 2000, an additional set of 5 was added, of micro models.<br>
    In August of 2001, the documents included 7 each micro and macro for 14 
    models.<br>
    In early September 2001 one more macro and one more micro model was added.<br>
    These models have been rendered all the more relevant in light of 9/11/01.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    The original model set was applied to the June 2000 <a href="acolumbineps.html">Columbine 
      P.S. </a>paper on education, on this web site.&nbsp; Those original 10<br>
    models are the same.&nbsp; What is changed is the addition of three more 
    models each for macro and micro situations.<br>
    <br>
    As before, the models are for use in conflict resolution, to enable the 
    establishing of dialogue between all stakeholders by<br>
    enabling them to conduct their own dialogue marathon:&nbsp; 8 at the macro-societal 
    and institutional level, and 8 at the<br>
    micro-individual level for use in face-to-face encounters, whether the 
    other individual(s) does or does no represent a larger<br>
    institution of society.&nbsp; These models can be used to avoid what is 
    often a disastrous swing of the pendulum, in order to<br>
    enable all involved to use what is described below as a &#147;calculus 
    of meaning&#148; and a &#147;calculus of pain&#148; to assist in their<br>
    deliberations.&nbsp; <br>

    representatives of Institutions, on a formal basis.<br>
    <br>
    Regarding the 16 models of conflict resolution<br>
  <br>
    This continues my quest to both understand conflicts and to develop workable 
    resolutions for such conflicts, whether<br>
    personal (micro) or between larger aggregations of individuals in the 
    institutions and nations of society and the world<br>
    (macro).&nbsp; I began the list with a total of 5 macro in 1997, with 
    the micro being added in 1999.&nbsp; As new ones are learned of,<br>
    they are added.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    Peter Berger has coined, among many highly useful terms, this pair: &quot;historically 
    specific conservatives&quot; (those of<br>
    the left or right who would usher in their desired type of society and 
    then freeze it in place) and &#147;historically nonspecific<br>
    conservatives&quot; (those who accept change and make haste slowly).&nbsp; 
    I find them so much more useful as a way of looking<br>
    at the ideological landscape (as it cannot be avoided).&nbsp; As I also 
    state on those pages, this and another pair of Berger&#146;s<br>
    analytical word tools,&quot;calculus of meaning&quot; and &quot;calculus 
    of pain&quot;, are, in my judgment, the critical one- two punch of<br>
    analysis and conflict resolution.&nbsp; They are two of the four key organizing 
    principles for dealing with such conflict resolution,<br>
    along with the concepts of &quot;lists/recipes&quot; and collaboration.&nbsp; 
    &quot;Recipes&quot; comes from Berger as well, through Alfred Schutz.&nbsp;<br>
    All of which I would make a part of what Cassidy call &#147;the politics 
    of love,&#148; which has to be both the umbrella over and<br>
    foundation under all discussions and interactions if true conflict resolution 
    is to be achieved in a way that love and justice<br>
    pervades and is received and perceived by both sides.&nbsp; These models 
    are of particular importance and relevance in the<br>
    continuing conflicts in the world today, whether by nation-states or independent 
    groups dedicated to changing society<br>
    through violence.<br>
  <br>
    THE 8 MACRO MODELS<br>
  <br>
    FIRST:&nbsp; Masada, a &quot;how NOT to work things out. It is a story 
    set in Palestine/Israel of 72 A.D.&nbsp; It is a story of the failure 
    to<br>
    attempt or trust mediation (although it is not known if any was attempted).&nbsp; 
    The Zealots, on top of the 1300 foot plateau,<br>
    were unable to prevent the Romans' slow, methodical, progress of building 
    a ramp to the top of the sheer cliff in order to<br>
    breach their defenses (FN#13).&nbsp; It is a lesson in both international 
    and local politics and an opportunity to understand our<br>
    own behavior better.&nbsp; &quot;Masada&quot; was a four part ABC Novel 
    for Television, April 5-8, 1981.&nbsp; Having people watch the video<br>
    tape would be an excellent dynamic.&nbsp; CIS (Cultural Information Service), 
    in NYC, wrote a marvelous study guide for it, that<br>
    stands alone as a guide to any discussion regarding conflict resolution, 
    peace, etc., as well.&nbsp; It is 15 pages, with pictures, on<br>
    11x14 paper (FN#14)<br>
  <br>
    SECOND:&nbsp; &quot;The Evangelical Academies&quot; model of post World 
    War II West Germany, where the mediator is the faith<br>
    community, discussed in the book Confession, Conflict &amp; Community.&nbsp; 
    They were established by the faith community.&nbsp; In a<br>
    word, unlike Humpty Dumpty and all the king's men, they&nbsp; were able 
    to help put West Germany back together again, as &quot;the<br>
    academies played a singular role in restoring the democratic idea after 
    the disaster of the Third Reich.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;The Evangelical<br>
    Academies&quot; have been in continuous use, and were central to the recreation 
    of West Germany.&nbsp; These &quot;academies&quot; provided<br>
    a sense of dialogue between all the parties, fostering and enabling a 
    kind of &quot;mediating action&quot; to take place between the<br>
    social and political forces (not as in arbitration or in seeking compromise, 
    but rather in the sense of creating a &quot;zone of<br>
    freedom&quot; in which the concerns of all sides could be brought to bear 
    upon the urgent issues before them, using a set general<br>
    process agendas in which the specifics could be discussed and dealt with 
    by all concerned.&nbsp; The meetings were held outside<br>
    the cities in the country side, with minimal distractions, and always 
    with a mixed group of stakeholders.&nbsp; The first conference<br>
    brought together &quot;150 lawyers and economists&quot; and later ones 
    &quot;laborers, farmers, physicians, and social service<br>
    workers--people from all walks of life.&quot;&nbsp; A key lesson learned 
    was the importance and &quot;necessity for each<br>
    occupational group within the framework of modern society to encounter 
    the group that it most complained<br>
    about.&quot;&nbsp; (FN#6)&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    The academies continued through the decades, with problems addressed ranging 
    from road locations to international issues<br>
    of concern.&nbsp; 19 Academies continue today under an umbrella association, 
    and is working with similar movements in Africa,<br>
    Asia and America.&nbsp; They were also used in East Germany to give citizens 
    a place to gather and discuss prior to the fall of the<br>
    Berlin Wall (prior to which over 1,500 conferences were held each year), 
    and then used later to help in the reunification of<br>
    West Germany and East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. (FN#7)&nbsp; 
    Why not regarding education in America?&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    THIRD:&nbsp; the mediation model used in South Africa.&nbsp; The model 
    is outlined as a theoretical piece as well as being discussed<br>
    in the practical terms of its actual use in this setting.&nbsp; The 1989 
    book The Passing Summer : A South African's Response to<br>
    White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love, by Michael Cassidy, 
    discusses the situational complex of apartheid in the<br>
    summer of 1986, including the several centuries of actions that led to 
    apartheid.&nbsp; The actual South Africa mediation model is<br>
    outlined in the 1988 book A Future South Africa:&nbsp; Visions, Strategies, 
    and Realities, edited by Peter L. Berger and Bobby<br>
    Godsell (FN#8). On page 320-321 of the Berger-Godsell book is the &quot;Analytic 
    Scheme&quot; for guiding the research and, on pp.<br>
    322-323, is Peter Berger's outline for &quot;reality-testing&quot; what 
    is being done.&nbsp; The change in South Africa, as anywhere else, did<br>
    not &quot;just&quot; happen.&nbsp; The Berger-Godsell report was released 
    in 1988, two years before Nelson Mandella was released from<br>
    prison, who was then elected President in 1994.&nbsp; After 1988 and 1989, 
    the contents of these two books merged in the<br>
    conferences that were held to discuss the transition out of apartheid.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    In an update received from Bobby Godsell in March 2000, he discusses four 
    additional conferences which were particularly<br>
    helpful, conferences which bear witness to how well this model can be 
    used successfully all along the spectrum of<br>
    stakeholder positions.&nbsp; The four conferences were:&nbsp; (1) 1989, 
    called by the then new Afrikaner Nationalist president, FW<br>
    de Klerk to address the problems of political violence (which the African 
    National Conference boycotted); (2) 1994:&nbsp; called<br>
    by a Kenyan Bishop which resulted in involving the Inkatha Movement, led 
    by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, just weeks before the<br>
    first democratic election in 1994, enabling it to join the now cooperating 
    ANC and de Klerk government; (3-4) the use of the<br>
  &quot;reality testing&quot; model of the referenced 1988 book by groups 
    on the far right and left:&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Broederbond, a secret<br>
    Afrikaner Nationalist intellectual organization, led during this critical 
    period by J P de Lange, and by the South African<br>
    Communist Party.&nbsp; Of these latter two, Bobby Godsell states, &quot;In 
    both cases they concluded that [their old] strategies were<br>
    not possible,&quot; and thus they too joined to work cooperatively with 
    the other stakeholders regarding South Africa's<br>
    development&quot; (FN#11).&nbsp; And such mediation continues.&nbsp; Godsell 
    also reports (FN#9) that &quot;Evangelical Christianity continues<br>
    to play a surprising role in providing a common road to modernity for 
    black and white, left and right&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (FN#10).&nbsp; It is 
    the<br>
  &quot;common road,&quot; properly given a &quot;realty testing,&quot; 
    which provides its users with a peaceful outcome as well as opportunity 
    to<br>
    move toward a more just one. Perhaps the title of Michael Cassidy's book 
    shows us why it worked in South Africa and why it<br>
    can work in education in the United States:&nbsp; The Passing Summer : 
    A South African's Response to White Fear,<br>
    Black Anger, and the Politics of Love.&nbsp; Fear and anger clouded both 
    the presentation of issues and judgment about<br>
    them.&nbsp; Love, in the form of the Golden Rule, was used.&nbsp; Love, 
    however defined, whether in terms of civility of discourse,<br>
    civility in relational interaction, or both, can enable the Archimedian 
    lever of mediation to enable the resolution of the<br>
    problems to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.<br>
  <br>
    FOURTH:&nbsp; The Oslo Accords Process being used in the Middle East to 
    resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian<br>
    Authority was begun in the woods of Norway.&nbsp; See The New Yorker article, 
    Annals of Diplomacy section (Dec. 20, 1993, pp.<br>
    77-85):&nbsp; &quot;THE PEACEMAKERS&quot;.&nbsp; Subhead:&nbsp; &quot;In 
    Norway, two Israeli academics [the initial mediators] worked for months 
    to<br>
    broker the secret peace--and succeeded where governments had failed.&quot;&nbsp; 
    The initial success of what is being called &quot;The<br>
    Oslo Accords&quot; has come about because both sides agreed to leave the 
    most contentious issues until last (West bank, the final<br>
    settlement of Jerusalem, and full sovereignty passed to the Palestinian 
    Authority, or &quot;PA&quot;, among others of the most<br>
    thorniest issues), so as to work on the areas on which there either was 
    agreement or clear room for negotiation.&nbsp; The<br>
    theory:&nbsp; that the process of working together would enable both sides 
    to become familiar with each other, break down the<br>
    walls between them, and develop a kind of trust that would enable them, 
    after resolving the &quot;are negotiable&quot; issues to finally<br>
    tackle the major issues separating both sides, issues which were originally 
    labeled &quot;non-negotiable.&quot;&nbsp; Theory problem:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    unlike with West Germany and South Africa, a common faith bond between 
    the two sides is missing.&nbsp; Rather than gradually<br>
    reconciling with each other (made possible by the use of love, the basis 
    of any faith community context), the process has<br>
    been one sided, without reconciliation because of the continued propaganda 
    of hate and fanatic Islamism, which has<br>
    been the staple of the Palestinian culture since the creation of the Jewish 
    state in 1948, and the demand from certain Israeli<br>
    elements of a restoration of Israel as in Biblical times.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The irony is that the Masada roles are now reversed.&nbsp; The<br>
    Palestinian Authority is acting the role of Rome wanting the Israeli's 
    to act the role of the 1st century Zealots and kill<br>
    themselves.&nbsp; In its current state, this model is actually moving 
    toward the Palestinian goal of a Masada-like conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To put it bluntly, the &quot;Oslo Accords&quot; need the &quot;politics 
    of love&quot; (Model #5 below) if the negotiators are to avoid the Masada<br>
    affect.&nbsp; The empirical reality is that the presence of the acknowledgement 
    of love in Models 2 and 3 were successful, and that<br>
    its absence led to the failure of #1 and is leading to the failure of 
    #4.&nbsp; #5 organizes this principle for any macro-level conflict<br>
    negotiation.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    FIFTH, the mediation model based on Michael Cassidy's &quot;The Politics 
    of Love,&quot; in his book The Passing Summer : A South<br>
    African's Response to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    Cassidy proposed this model for South Africa, with the urging that it 
    be incorporated in the country's constitution.&nbsp; As 78% of<br>
    South Africans (Black and White) professed to be Christians, the politics 
    of love followed their shared belief that &quot;God is<br>
    love.&quot;&nbsp; The model served as an inspiration to themselves regarding 
    letting their better natures prevail as continues to serve<br>
    as in inspiration to other peoples of the planet caught in the same kind 
    of process.&nbsp; The model is also practical, in that<br>
  &quot;the golden rule is finally what life is all about&quot; and is at 
    the heart of every major world religion and most<br>
    secular philosophies. &nbsp;But how does a nation or large institution 
    incorporate the golden rule all claim to want to follow but<br>
    find so difficult to follow?&nbsp; Through love, which turns revenge into 
    treating perpetrators of prejudice with the respect and<br>
    civility.&nbsp; Cassidy regarding meetings with the head of detentions:&nbsp; 
    &quot;I grasped afresh that South African blacks, and especially<br>
    black Christians, are in many ways incredible. Their capacity to bear 
    pain, to tolerate indignity, to dredge up new goodwill<br>
    from who knows where and still be gracious, never ceases to amaze me&quot; 
    (p. 19).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Cassidy discusses his ten point model in detail in his book's Part Six, 
    &quot;The Politics of Love (The outworking of love as a valid<br>
    political principle,&quot; in three chapters, Chapter 19 (&quot;Winning 
    in the World's Workshop&quot; based on the Swiss Hans-Ruedi Weber<br>
    referring to South Africa as &quot;the laboratory of the world,&quot; 
    in 1973, for how they did would greatly affect the world's belief in<br>
    what is possible), Chapter 20 (&quot;Love as a Political Virtue&quot; 
    which is to sing songs Cassidy doesn't mention but which relate,<br>
    the Dianne Warwick song &quot;What the world needs now, is love, love, 
    love&quot;, or the song made popular world-wide by Michael<br>
    Jackson and Pepsi Cola about the world needing love or Disney's &quot;It&#146;s 
    a Small, Small World After All&quot;), and Chapter 21<br>
    (&quot;Love in Structures&quot;, as in the constitution, etc.).&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    The 10 point model proposed in 1988 by Cassidy, p. 425, which is needed 
    by those involved in The Oslo Accords and any other global &quot;hot spots&quot; 
    needing conflict resolution, is:</p>

  <p>In her book, The Human Condition, the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt says 
    we keep chaos at bay by keeping promises and that we<br>
    deal with the irreversibility of our words and deeds through forgiveness, 
    that forgiveness and reconciliation are not the provenance<br>
    of Christians, although Jesus emphasizes it more than anyone, but rather 
    that both are necessary because of the &quot;human condition.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
    To forgive in order to be reconciled requires loving.&nbsp; Love is what 
    is missing in the Middle East with the Oslo Accords.&nbsp; Without love, 
    it will<br>
    ultimately fail.&nbsp; Love and reconciliation are a necessary part of 
    the human condition.<br>
    <br>
    Macro models 2, 3 and 5 show love as a key ingredient for macro conflict 
    resolution.&nbsp; Models 1 and 4 suggest that its lack prevents<br>
    resolution.&nbsp; There is the evidence of another contemporary, long 
    term, unresolved, unreconciled, loveless conflict:&nbsp; Korea.&nbsp; 
    The unsuccessful<br>
    threatening Cold War rhetoric of Washington has not worked.&nbsp; The 
    recent summit between North and South Korea was brought about by<br>
    South Korea's Kim Dae Jung, using a mix of Christian compassion and Confucian 
    sincerity.&nbsp; If this continues, this country could also be<br>
    reconciled, using the &quot;politics of love.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    SIXTH, the 1975 Helsinki Accords, In terms of the Helsinki Accords, I 
    would juxtapose them with the Oslo Accords as well as with<br>
    Masada, both of which failed (interestingly enough, both failures were 
    in the Middle East), as I predicted in the items I'm sending to you, as<br>
    both Oslo and Masada were unable to either recognize and/deal with hate 
    and mistrust, and neither was able to view with love.&nbsp; According 
    to<br>
    Natan Sharansky, the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords by the Soviet 
    tyrants was when they &quot;signed their own death warrant&quot;&nbsp; 
    (&quot;Why<br>
    Weren't the Helsinki Standards Also Used for Oslo?&#148; Wall Street Journal, 
    May 14, 2001, p. A18).&nbsp; This &quot;third basket&quot; meant the Soviets<br>
    and their puppets were agreeing&nbsp; &quot;to uphold the basic human 
    rights of their own subjects&quot;, although they had no intentions of 
    doing so.&nbsp;<br>
    But this was the &quot;Achilles' heel of the totalitarian state&quot; 
    as all actions were then scrutinized by world opinion according to this<br>
    agreement (that, plus going bankrupt trying to keep up the arms race, 
    while also intervening militarily in Vietnam and Afghanistan).&nbsp; The<br>
  &quot;Kremlin eventually buckled under the strain,&quot; as, &quot;forced 
    to relax their tyranny, they released a spark of freedom that spread like 
    a<br>
    bush fire and burned down an empire&quot;, a reminder from the East to 
    the West that &quot;freedom has the power to change the world.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Sharansky<br>
    says the real lesson lost by the Oslo accord folks was that the Soviet 
    &quot;historic collapse was shaped by the moral authority of dissidents&quot; 
    in<br>
    Russia and the moral authority of certain political leaders in the U.S. 
    willing to use the phrase &quot;evil empire,&quot; which brought near 
    apoplexy from<br>
    the left in this country. Sharansky&#146;s bottom line:&nbsp; &quot;the 
    Oslo accords failed to establish any connection between human rights and<br>
    the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.&quot;<br>
  <br>
    SEVENTH, the &#147;third track diplomacy&#148; contributions and structures 
    of the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Mozambique,<br>
    Central and South America, and South Korea.&nbsp; Berger reminds us that 
    the U.S. population as a whole is as religious as India<br>
    whereas the political and academic elites are as secular as Sweden.&nbsp; 
    This explains to me why they can't deal with morality, as it<br>
    would be a foot in the door for religion, and religion must be stamped 
    out at every point (see comment on Voltaire below).&nbsp; And religion,<br>
    more than any other, teaches morality and love.&nbsp; The recent (1999) 
    book edited by Peter Berger, The Desecularization of the World:&nbsp;<br>
    Resurgent Religion and World Politics, includes a piece by George Weigel, 
    &quot;Roman Catholicism in the Age of John Paul II.&quot;&nbsp; In it 
    he<br>
    discusses what John Paul II has done as well as the &quot;third track 
    diplomacy&quot; of the Rome-based San' Egidio Community, which he says 
    has<br>
    played important roles in 3rd track, &quot;most successfully in Mozambique.&quot;<br>
  <br>
    Another major difference is the lack of a concept of sin on the political 
    left, for if there is no sin, how can what one is doing be all that wrong?&nbsp;<br>
    The moral strength of Gandhi in India was not his but England's self image 
    as a moral nation, sinful though it may be, but one that didn&#146;t<br>
    slaughter people, and thus had to withdraw on those moral grounds (a concept 
    totally missing, of course in the Soviet Union and any past<br>
    and present Marxist states).&nbsp; Ditto in South Africa:&nbsp; it was 
    the vision of people, Black and White, both Christians, that enabled apartheid 
    to<br>
    be put back in its box.&nbsp; The key now is to prevent its reverse.&nbsp; 
    And the civil rights movement in this country was also fought on a moral<br>
    base.&nbsp; Martin Luther King could not have been as effective as he 
    was, nor the supreme court able to rule as it did, if it wasn&#146;t for 
    the moral<br>
    sense that counted, the moral sense of everyday Americans, who were revulsed 
    by such scenes as Bull Connor&#146;s dogs and the beating of<br>
    unarmed, peaceful marchers, not to mention the bombing of little girls 
    and the lynching of innocent men, and who said, &#147;but that is not 
    us,&#148;<br>
    ushering in the change.&nbsp; What nation can survive without such a moral 
    base as it relates to its citizens and to its fellow<br>
    nations?<br>
  <br>
    But even in moral nations, we need the &quot;politics of love&quot; (sin, 
    and all that, one must recall, aren&#146;t going away).&nbsp; Too many 
    seem to<br>
    have Voltaire's wish.&nbsp; Weigel writes that Voltaire &quot;died with 
    the wish that the last king be strangled with the guts of the last priest.&quot;&nbsp; 
    For all of his<br>
    defense to the death of one&#146;s right to speak their opinion, &quot;the 
    revolution he helped to inspire defined its goal as little less than the 
    overthrow<br>
    of the civilization the Church had helped nurture for centuries.&quot;&nbsp; 
    When I was in graduate school, those of my fellow grad students who were<br>
    Marxists told me I would be one of the first ones shot come the revolution 
    (which they sincerely believed would come).&nbsp; I said yes, but you'll<br>
    be beside me, as the first to go are the intellectuals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduate 
    school in the classroom with Berger was exciting, but with fellow grads<br>
    disappointing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The left is so lacking in balanced morals (and 
    the concept of &#147;moral equivalency&#148; negates morals, making what 
    is moral what<br>
    one personally &#147;feels&#148; to be moral, i.e., anything anyone does).&nbsp; 
    But how can you have a sense of morals that is all encompassing of all<br>
    people if you don't have a concept of sin and therefore believe any action 
    of one&#146;s own can&#146;t, by definition be wrong?&nbsp; If one thinks 
    it OK it is<br>
    by definition OK, as seen by those who are &#147;historically specific 
    conservatives&#148; on both the left and right.<br>
    <br>
    EIGHTH, putting top representatives of conflicting organizations in the 
    anchoring environment of a Round Table, as was used by King<br>
    Author for his Knights of the Round Table, in order to get them to act 
    cooperatively together, and as was used by Katherine Graham,<br>
    Publisher of The Washington Post, to foster open communications where 
    suspicioned communications existed before (just as its counter<br>
    part, #8 in micro, is on an informal basis).&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <br>
    THE 8 MICRO MODELS<br>
  <br>
    Those interested in education in any town or city, are urged to think 
    beyond the conflict resolution process at the institutional level (the 
    5<br>
    macro models above) and think also of the conflict resolution process 
    within their own minds between their &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; 
    selves as<br>
    well as between themselves and those they must resolve conflicts with 
    face to face, at home, at work, or at school (the 5 micro models<br>
    below).&nbsp; A recommended starting place is to consider either the adoption 
    of one of the following models or the development of another<br>
    model taking elements from any of the other models, whether approached 
    in terms of outcomes or in terms of personal procedures to<br>
    follow.&nbsp; These micro, face-to-face relationship models can enable 
    people to approach different tasks using the terminology of the field<br>
    of conflict resolution, enabling the kinds of effective inter-personal 
    relationships that will foster, support and sustain task completion.<br>
    <br>
    FIRST:&nbsp; a full spectrum model from lose-lose to win-win, to use as 
    a guide in how well you are doing in developing a win-win model, with<br>
    the outcome goal being that of collaboration, as seen on the following 
    Chart of Win-Lose Strategies for Task Completion/Relationship<br>
    Building.<br>

  <p>TASK COMPLETION [from unassertiveness to assertiveness]<br>
    Personal Relationship Building and Task Completion In Terms of Win-Lose 
    Strategies<br>
    <br>
    The previous chart was adapted by Peter Jessen from the model presented 
    by John Conhere who in tern presented his adaptation of the<br>
    model of Ken Thomas, in Conhere's &#147;Peer Mediation&#148; presentation, 
    Fridley Middle School, Fridley, MN, Jan. 19, 1993, and used by Peter<br>
    Jessen in his presentation of &#147;THE MOTIVATION ZONE:&nbsp; Heroes 
    at Work with Heroes in Training:&nbsp; Background, Rationale and &#145;Curriculum&#146;<br>
    For Parents &amp; Kids,&#148;&nbsp; before a meeting of the Wilson Cluster 
    Parent Connection Meeting, Wilson High School, Portland, OR, March 11,<br>
    1996, and before the Wilson High School Leadership Group in December 1998. <br>
  <br>
    Key to task success is to understand how to meld each stakeholder's and 
    stakeholder group's plans, agendas and &quot;to do lists&quot; into a 
    recipe<br>
    which includes the concept of collaboration.&nbsp; Following Meichenbaum's 
    Facilitating Treatment Adherence:&nbsp; A [medical] Practitioner's<br>
    Guidebook, by Donald Meichenbaum and Dennis C. Turk;&nbsp; and Meichenbaum 
    personal statement to Peter Jessen) &quot;collaboration&quot; is further<br>
    defined as that which must be understood within the context that no collaboration 
    can take place unless everything is negotiable.&nbsp;<br>
  &quot;Non-negotiable&quot; means conflicts cannot be resolved and collaboration 
    cannot be achieved.&nbsp; Without collaboration on negotiable items, there<br>
    can be no Win-Win.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each group must drop its Wizard of Oz-ian 
    curtains.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Referring to Chart: Left to right = ascending degree of task completion.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom to top = ascending quality 
    of relationships.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Avoidance (not face) = lose -&nbsp; lose.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    Accommodates (giving in) = lose - win, as high level of task completion 
    is sacrificed for the sense of relationship.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Controller = win-lose is at the other end of the spectrum is the (where 
    high task completions are obtained by sacrificing relationships).&nbsp; 
    And<br>
    although compromise has some value, its half win, half lose (not very 
    satisfying to either).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Collaboration is the one that is highest in both relationship building 
    and task completion.&nbsp; Collaboration is the only one which is win-win 
    and<br>
    the best for long-term win-win.&nbsp; BUT, collaboration only works with 
    that which is negotiable.&nbsp; Caveat:&nbsp; &quot;consensus trumps collaboration&quot;<br>
    (&quot;consensus leadership&quot; allows one or two stop the rest in their 
    tracks).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    SECOND: a win-lose matrix model for fostering the developing a win-win 
    model of development of the young by their elders (parents<br>
    and teachers).&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    This model was adapted from Mary Pipher, Rescuing Ophelia:&nbsp; Saving 
    the Selves of Adolescent Girls, p. 83, by Peter Jessen, and<br>
    used in his November 12, 1996 presentation before the Wilson Cluster Parent 
    Connection:&nbsp; &quot;From the 'Reviving of Ophelia' to 'The Shelter<br>
    of Each Other':&nbsp; The Questions, Answers, and Tools Mary Pipher Offers 
    For Use in 'Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls' and in<br>

    This matrix outlines the outcomes that result with any of the four control 
    strategies implemented by adults over their young, whether at home<br>
    or at school.&nbsp; The favored outcome is a strategy which includes high 
    affection and acceptance by the adults, meaning, in a word, love.&nbsp; 
    This<br>
    one is favored because the outcome is an independent, socially responsible, 
    and confident young man or woman. <br>
    <br>
    Indeed, Part III of her book The Shelter of Each Other is entitled:&nbsp; 
    &quot;Solutions:&nbsp; What will survive of us is love.&quot;&nbsp; In 
    this she is in agreement with<br>
    Cassidy (Macro model #3).&nbsp; The following matrix responds to Mary 
    Pipher's question:&nbsp; &quot;Under what conditions will young men and 
    women<br>
    flower and grow?&quot;</p>

    THIRD:&nbsp; a set of personal self-talk or internal-dialogues, with the 
    outcome goal being that of developing a sense of learned optimism, not<br>
    learned helplessness, so as to raise one's Adversity Quotient, for the 
    higher the AQ the easier and more successful one will be in<br>
    overcoming adversity.&nbsp; The clue concept is that of self-talk, of 
    which there are several models, which are discussed in Appendix C.&nbsp; 
    All of<br>
    them can be subsumed under Paul Stoltz's concept with the book title of 
    the same name:&nbsp; Adversity Quotient:&nbsp; Turning Obstacles into<br>
    Opportunities.&nbsp; Stoltz notes that the American Psychological Association 
    considers the &quot;learned helplessness&quot; concept of Martin E.P.<br>
    Seligman, as &quot;the Landmark Theory of the Century.&quot;&nbsp; It 
    explains why people give up or stop short when faced with life's challenges.&nbsp; 
    This<br>
    theory suggests that the shooters at Columbine felt helpless.&nbsp; The 
    concept &quot;Learned Helplessness&quot; is the personal thought process 
    of<br>
  &quot;simply internalizing the belief that what you do does not matter.&quot;&nbsp; 
    The old wisdom statement is &quot;As a man thinketh.&quot;&nbsp; Stoltz 
    has created two<br>
    ways of using self-talk (again, see Appendix C) to be positive, optimistic, 
    and tackle any challenge. &nbsp;These two are CO2RE and LEAD.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To Stoltz, adversity is like a mountain to climb (a &quot;vertical&quot; 
    version of the &quot;horizontal&quot; version of running a marathon).&nbsp; 
    Three types attempt the<br>
    climb:&nbsp; quitters, who either don't start or who quit soon after starting; 
    campers, who climb for a while and then pitch their tents hoping for<br>
    conditions to change that they prefer, and just keep waiting, and climbers, 
    who continue, no matter what, to the top.&nbsp; Stoltz's goal for us:&nbsp; 
    to<br>
    each develop and nurture as high an AQ behavior as possible, to grow a 
    high AQ culture in every organization or group in which one<br>
    participates, and to thereby each is emailed tpunleash each of our full 
    potential.&nbsp; The key question (p. 281):&nbsp; &quot;How important 
    is it for you to<br>
    strengthen your AQ and your ability to climb through adversity?&quot;&nbsp; 
    Like Stoltz, we all want to achieve Seligman's &quot;Learned optimism&quot; 
    as a<br>
    way to change beliefs such that one can see that it does matter what they 
    try, and that they also matter.&nbsp; Stoltz has three key terms:<br>
    <br>
  &nbsp; CO2RE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    LEADing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Vision<br>
    <br>
    Learn CO2RE (p. 115) and LEADing (p. 154) to create a climbing culture, 
    and develop the Vision (pp. 284-5) needed to sustain it.&nbsp;<br>
    Teaching AQ to others gives them a great gift:&nbsp; the ability to confront 
    challenge after challenge <br>
    <br>
    C = Control:&nbsp; focus on what you can control, not what you cannot 
    control<br>
    O2 = Origin and Ownership (how did it start; what is your part of the 
    solution)<br>
    <br>
    R = Reach (goal:&nbsp; don't allow catastrophising to spill over into 
    other areas)<br>
    <br>
    E = Endurance (to reduce how long the adversity will last)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
    L = Listen to your adversity response:&nbsp; high or low?<br>
    E = Explore all origins and your own ownership of the result<br>
    A = Analyze the evidence (regarding whether you have no control, regarding 
    if it really must <br>
    reach other areas, and regarding whether it really has to last a long 
    time)<br>
    D = Do something!&nbsp; (act).<br>
  <br>
    p. 155:&nbsp; &quot;The LEAD sequence is based on the notion that anyone 
    can alter their success by changing their habits of thought.&nbsp; Change 
    is<br>
    created by disputing old patterns and consciously forming new ones.&quot;<br>
  <br>
    Proverbs 29:18:&nbsp; &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Stoltz says that to overcome adversity in a sustained way, one must first<br>
    dream the dream, then make the dream into a vision, and then sustain the 
    vision, hold on to it, and not let it go.&nbsp; P. 287:&nbsp; &quot;AQ 
    is not a quick fix,<br>
    but rather an enduring formula built on a fundamental truth that life 
    is hard--but how you handle it determines your destiny.&quot;&nbsp; Recall 
    the<br>
    discussion above of Frankl:&nbsp; even though life is filled with suffering, 
    guilt, and death, individuals can still derive meaning from their pain 
    and<br>
    suffering.&nbsp; Because of vision, people know the joy of &quot;life 
    is beautiful:&nbsp; &quot;As long as one is alive, they can ascend.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    FOURTH:&nbsp; the model &quot;Managing Conflict for Individual &amp; Team 
    Success At Home and At School,&quot; presented to the Wilson Cluster<br>
    Parent Connection, May 13, 1997, by Sam Imperati, Executive Director for 
    The Institute for Conflict Management, Inc., and JoAnn Hjouck,<br>
    Mediator, Solomon's Tree.&nbsp; This model begins with the reality that 
    &quot;conflict arises in all relationships,&quot; that conflict arises 
    when someone insists<br>
    they are right and you are wrong, and that the goal is to avoid the &quot;standard&quot; 
    model, stated tongue in cheek, of &quot;I'll listen to your unreasonable<br>
    demands if you'll consider my unacceptable offer,&quot; and that to succeed 
    in conflict resolution, even between two people, those involved must<br>
    act as a team even when they come from different places/organizations/families/schools, 
    etc.&nbsp; And although not a replacement for the<br>
    traditional legal process, it can compliment it by providing a creative, 
    economical and effective alternative to expensive law suits.&nbsp; This 
    means<br>
    that those in conflict but build relationships, not a case, and that they 
    must understand that they are to fix a problem not fix blame.&nbsp; This 
    model<br>
    has four steps:<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Identify the problem by getting both sides to understand 
    what the other's position(s) and argument(s) is/are and to recognize that 
    they<br>
    can solve the problem.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Explore the problem by looking at the underlying values, 
    needs, and interests of each party, identifying what each has in common, 
    and<br>
    then exploring the best case-worst case scenarios regarding the consequences 
    of not reaching a resolution.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
  &nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Develop solutions by listing all possible solutions, and 
    then exploring the options in terms of which solutions satisfy common 
    interests<br>
    (O.P.T.I.O.N.S.:&nbsp; only proposals that include others' needs succeed).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
  &nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Select and implement a solution by negotiating a winning 
    solution that will generate full support now and in the future, and not 
    ending<br>
    without laying out procedures to follow if what is worked out worsens 
    or, for whatever reason, the agreement reached is not working.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    FIFTH:&nbsp; the Lists/Recipes for empowering both sides to achieve success 
    model, compiled by Peter J. Jessen.&nbsp; As human beings have<br>
    no instincts for social interaction (Berger's phrase), they &quot;create 
    instinct substitutes&quot; (Gehlen's phrase).&nbsp; They create habits.&nbsp; 
    These habits are<br>
    said to follow the recipes needed for success.&nbsp; People seek &quot;recipe 
    knowledge&quot; (Schutz's phrase).&nbsp; <br>
    It derives from three concepts:&nbsp; (1) the social fact that humans 
    have no instincts for human interaction nor for keeping track of things, 
    and<br>
    that to survive, must create &quot;instinct substitutes,&quot; which are 
    call roles.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every situation in which any person finds themselves, 
    is a stage, and<br>
    each stage has its own called for role playing, behavior, costume, etc.&nbsp; 
    No one can live a role free existence.&nbsp; (2), because of this,<br>
    anyone can, individually and collectively, be a playwright and participate 
    in creating the stages on which they play, and the plays in<br>
    which they play their roles.&nbsp; (3), individuals&nbsp; are capable 
    of not only living in multiple realities AND are capable of emigrating 
    freely<br>
    back and forth between them.&nbsp; Nothing, therefore, is inevitable.&nbsp; 
    All can be negotiated, worked out (except in those cases where<br>
    individuals or groups choose not to.&nbsp; This also means that role playing 
    is more important than one's feelings, that no matter how one feels, the<br>
    old theatre adage that &quot;the show must go on&quot; is far more prevalent 
    as a reflection of the realities of life than &quot;when I get energized 
    and feel<br>
    great&quot; I will get going.&nbsp; This must be the attitude of any who 
    would overcome adversity and anyone who would engage in the &quot;school<br>
    mission marathon&quot; to answer the questions before us, let along the 
    attitude that must be in the heads of both students and<br>
    teachers/administrators, if all of them are to get the most out of the 
    K-12 educational experience marathon.&nbsp; Lists/recipes for action are 
    key to<br>
    organizing the thoughts and actions one needs to achieve goals.&nbsp; 
    Some of lists include those of Stephen Covey's &quot;7 Habits Habits of<br>
    Highly Effective People and Families,&quot; Benjamin Franklin's list of 
    13 areas for achieving personal and professional success, the list of 
    Dale<br>
    Carnegie's success principles, the list of success principles of Napoleon 
    Hill and W. Clement Stone, 6 lists for goal setting by Zig Ziglar,<br>
    Tony Robbins, Robert Schuller, Peter Daniels, Paul Stoltz, and Napoleon 
    Hill, as well as a list of books of lists by Sam Deep and Lyle<br>
    Sussman.</p>
  <p>SIXTH:&nbsp; the Love each other model, as admonished by Jesus, the Buddha, 
    and Mohammed.&nbsp; Hannah Arendt says the human<br>
    condition requires forgiving others, as words and deeds are irreversible, 
    and keeping promises, as that keeps chaos at bay.&nbsp; Christians<br>
    celebrate the Jewish Passover as Maundy Thursday (Maundy having roots 
    from three languages:&nbsp;&nbsp; derived from mandatum, Latin,<br>
  &quot;commandment&quot;; also derived from the English, &quot;Mandate&quot;; 
    and derived from the French, &quot;Mande,&quot; meaning &quot;command&quot; 
    or &quot;mandate&quot;).&nbsp;<br>
    For some, it refers to Jesus foot washing of his disciples and His command 
    to serve one another.&nbsp; To others it refers to his command to<br>
    love one another (both of which are common to all peoples of the Book:&nbsp; 
    Christians, Jews, Moslems).&nbsp; To me it refers to and<br>
    includes both.&nbsp; Or, as the liturgy at <a href="http://www.rockies.net/%7Espirit/sermons/s-maundy-thursday.html">http://www.rockies.net/~spirit/sermons/s-maundy-thursday.html</a> states it:<br>
  <br>
    MAUNDY is an English form of the Latin word for commandment. The overarching 
    theme of Maundy Thursday is Jesus' new<br>
    commandment, given on this the eve of his death, to &quot;love one another 
    even as I have loved you&quot; (John 13:34) Maundy Thursday is<br>
    the night of the final meal that Jesus had with his disciples. The night 
    in which he washed his disciples feet, saying after he had done so: (John<br>
    13:12-17) &quot;Do you understand what I have done for you? You call me 
    'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that 
    I,<br>
    your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one 
    another's feet. I have set you an example that you<br>
    should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is 
    greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent<br>
    him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.<br>
  <br>
    What makes the events of 9/11/01 so mystifying for many, is that all three 
    religions who share and are all three called &#147;The Peoples of<br>
    The Book,&#148; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, have members with different 
    interpretations and who thus have adopted roles not of<br>
    loving and serving but of hating and killing.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    SEVENTH:&nbsp; the &#147;Serve others model&#148;, as admonished by Jesus, 
    the Buddha, and Mohammed.&nbsp; Albert Schweitzer said:&nbsp; &#147;I 
    don&#146;<br>
    know what you will do in life, but I do know you won&#146;t be happy until 
    you learn to serve others.&#148;<br>
    <br>
    EIGHTH:&nbsp; putting top individuals of conflicting organizations in 
    the anchoring environment of a Round Table, as was used by King<br>
    Author for his Knights of the Round Table, in order to get them to act 
    cooperatively together, and as was used by Katherine Graham,<br>
    Publisher of The Washington Post, to foster open communications where 
    suspicioned communications existed before. (just as its counter<br>
    part, in macro, is on a formal basis).&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    An excellent source of &quot;lists/recipes&quot; is any program based 
    on &#147;six sigma&#148;, the concept behind the concept of TQM (total 
    quality<br>
    management), which is to minimize errors and, thus, defects.&nbsp; Although 
    designed for organizations as a whole, it also designed for use<br>
    individually, and can be used by such disparate organizations as manufacturing 
    plants and public schools.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    A &#147;P.S.&#148; to these 8 macro and 8 micro models for conflict resolution<br>
  <br>
    Note that the 2 KEYS to all of these 16 models is their organization.&nbsp; 
    It is recommended that their organizational principle be<br>
    that of (1) &nbsp;L-I-S-T-S/R-E-C-I-P-E-S) (as part of goals, plans, contingencies, 
    time lines), and (2) c-o-l-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-I-o-n (with all as<br>
    negotiable).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    As Berger further points out, social scientists talk about the reality 
    that &quot;every society has its own corpus of officially accredited wisdom, 
    the<br>
    beliefs and values that most people take for granted as self-evidently 
    true.&quot;&nbsp; In terms of education, there are multiple realities 
    involved, each<br>
    viewing education differently, from the unique position of its own prism 
    of reality.&nbsp; This was not the case &quot;in the old days&quot;, when, 
    as Berger<br>
    writes:&nbsp; &quot;Every human society has institutions and functionaries 
    whose task it is to represent this putative truth, to transmit it to each 
    new<br>
    generation, to engage in rituals that reaffirm it, and sometimes to deal 
    (at least in words) with those who are benighted or wicked enough to<br>
    deny it.&quot;&nbsp; This used to be an easy task when there was a dominant 
    set of beliefs and values that everyone took for granted.&nbsp; But modern<br>
    society is pluralistic, with multiple realities or worldviews that change, 
    hence the saying of W.R. Inage, that &quot;he who would marry the spirit 
    of<br>
    the age soon becomes a widower.&quot; <br>
  <br>
    There are two other organizing principles which recommend for consideration 
    by both the macro models and the micro models, both<br>
    suggested by Peter Berger.&nbsp; The first is a &quot;calculus of meaning&quot; 
    and a &quot;calculus of pain,&quot; from his book Pyramids of Sacrifice:&nbsp; 
    Political<br>
    Ethics and Social Change, in which he suggests that policies should be 
    those which provide the most meaning and the least pain, and that<br>
    each calculus include a list of outcomes that are not desirable, in order 
    to avoid the mistake of believing because the intent is pure, so will 
    be<br>
    the outcome.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    Secondly, adapting from another analytical framework of Peter Berger, 
    it is recommended that each of the stakeholders in the discussions<br>
    that ensue review whether or not they are arguing from an ideological 
    position or not, whether they are actually flexible with their thinking,<br>
    and to ascertain whether or not they are being &quot;historically specific 
    conservatives&quot; or &quot;historically non-specific conservatives.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This eliminates the argument over content labels (liberal vs. conservative, 
    Democrat vs. Republican), and instead focuses on the process.&nbsp; In<br>
    this way, it can be state that both the radical left and the radical right 
    are, hopelessly and romantically, historically specific conservatives.&nbsp;<br>
    The radical left looks forward to a future putative utopia which, when 
    reached, is to be frozen in place, never to change, because utopia has<br>
    been achieved.&nbsp; The radical right looks backward to a putative golden 
    age which it wishes to resurrect, after which it too is to be frozen in<br>
    place, as the golden age has been retrieved.&nbsp; The historically NON-specific 
    conservative recognizes yet resists the impulse to fine a<br>
  &quot;good place&quot; and to then rest and keep it that way, but also 
    recognizes that it is better to make haste slowly, and that as most historical<br>
    actions have unintended consequences, one needs to be slow in assuming 
    that a proposed policy or action is the solution.&nbsp; The Spanish<br>
    Civil War, which, like all wars, was a conflict &quot;full of moral ambiguities, 
    with unspeakable brutality on both sides,&quot; in which a monument has<br>
    been erected to the million who died, a monument placed inside a mountain 
    not far from &quot;The Valley of the Fallen&quot;.&nbsp; Berger's chilling 
    words<br>
    about this should give us all pause and inspire us to be &quot;historically 
    non-specific conservatives&quot;:&nbsp; &nbsp;And the Spain that is now 
    emerging<br>
    has nothing to do with what either side fought and died for. &nbsp;&nbsp;Or, 
    as Cassidy put it in his book, &quot;Apartheid and all its works will 
    pass<br>
    away.&nbsp; So will every answer which replaces it, whether better and 
    nobler or yet more sinful and worse.&quot;</p>
