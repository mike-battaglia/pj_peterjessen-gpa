  <p>The reader is invited to write or call or E-mail them as well.</p>
  <p>See also www.vikingsstadium.com Here is the basic idea: IF the various 
    main stakeholder groups in Minnesota (teams and their owners &euro; legislators 
    and their jurisdictions &euro; state and city officials and agencies &euro; 
    Metrodome and its managers &euro; corporations and the university &euro; 
    urban/suburban/rural &euro; white/black/brown/ yellow &euro; fans and 
    non-fans &euro; and citizens of all ages and persuations) can see that 
    they are all partners in the sports-entertainment industry, THEN no one 
    will lose and all will be winners (in economic, cultural, and quality-of-life 
    terms). If each can help the other get what they need and what they want, 
    all will get what they need and want. That is always at the heart of any 
    great enterprise that involves great institutions and individuals. </p>
  <p>7 &quot;Good news&quot; points of these documents and attachments are: </p>
  <p>(1) The request of Red McCombs: &quot;Show me&quot; how a stadium deal 
    can be done is answered by the 10 financing/operations models and 6 attachments 
    (which can be used in a &quot;mix and match&quot; basis); </p>
  <p>(2) A 4 track &quot;Minnesota process&quot; is presented as a candidate 
    model to use for the overall process (Attachment #1), </p>
  <p>(3) The call of Dave Jennings for a Minnesota &quot;family discussion&quot; 
    to resolve the stadium questions is answered in the 14 models for resolving 
    conflict, </p>
  <p>(4) A group of models for conducting the communications component needed 
    between and among each other are in 47 communications models for use by 
    all parties involved to woo each other, especially wooing Red McCombs 
    and the tax payers; </p>
  <p>(5) 5 models are totally private funding models requiring no new taxes; </p>
  <p>(6) The models will also work to give the Gophers their own stadium, 
    and </p>
  <p>(7) 3 on-line idea resources among many are available, including Minneapolis 
    based www.vikingsstadium.com, and St. Paul based politalk-mn1@yahoogroups.com. 
    A great starting point for everyone&#146;s research is www.ceoexpress.com. 
    These materials combined with the work of the panel and a collective Minnesota 
    political will get it done. </p>
  <p>If one or more of the 10 financing/operational models are used, Minnesota 
    gains $1-2 billion/year in direct and indirect revenue/year from its investment 
    that it would not receive without the teams, not to mention the gains 
    in cultural and quality-of-life terms in keeping the Vikings in Minnesota. </p>
  <p>Minnesota CAN develop a private-public partnership to build and support 
    the stadiums needed/wanted by the Gophers, Twins, and Vikings, with little 
    or no new taxes, which meets the conditions and objections of the pro 
    and con sides regarding public funding. In so doing, the goal of all will 
    be met: that the people will benefit from the keeping their Vikings. </p>
  <p><b>The 10 models are:</b></p>
  <p>(1) The private investment/no new taxes models of (1) New Ballpark, Inc. 
    (led by the heads of Wells Fargo and US Bank in the Twin Cities) and (2) 
    C-17 for the Twins; </p>
  <p>(2) An earlier commercial real estate multi-use stadium complex proposal 
    made to the Twins, which would not require any new taxes or legislative 
    action.</p>
  <p>(3) The private-public Vikings model combines NFL and Vikings monies 
    ($150 million), stadium related revenue from taxing ($200 million), leaving 
    a gap of $150 million, which could be completely closed by a half cent 
    hotel/motel tax.</p>
  <p>(4) The multi-use facility/site model proposal made to the Vikings in 
    August 2000, with its claim of not needing any new taxes and incurring 
    no new debt.</p>
  <p>(5) The university funding models that were a part of #4, Appendix A.</p>
  <p>(6) The 40 ways to generate revenue in 26 revenue categories, which are 
    part of #4 above.</p>
  <p>(7) The private funding/no new taxes model proposed to the Vikings by 
    Lyle Berman</p>
  <p>(8) The private funding/no taxes model to proposed by Steve Young and 
    Brent Jones, with backing from Silicon Valley, as they search for a team 
    to buy.</p>
  <p>(9) The combination of a casino with a stadium, either (a) on a reservation 
    near the Twin Cities or (b) a state owned one from which the profits go 
    to pay for the stadium, etc.</p>
  <p>(10) A hybrid mix and match creatively developed from parts of any or 
    all of the above..</p>
  <p>I am convinced that Minnesota can make it happen, although some soul 
    searching and compromise will all be a part of it. The only real question 
    is: does Minnesota want to keep both the Twins and the Vikings? The fans 
    do. Most legislators do. A small minority do not. This letter this summarizes 
    and its attachments are about how to keep them with little or no new tax 
    dollars, and how to get that across all so that it is not misunderstood. 
    The outpouring of concern about Korey Stringer demonstrates the depth 
    of emotion held by Minnesotans for their Vikings.</p>
  <p>The key now is to make an announcement saying the stadium will happen, 
    leaving only the &quot;how&quot; to be worked out. The best wording I&#146;ve 
    seen so far is in the Vikings 2001 Official Team Guide, which, I believe 
    is what everyone either wants or at least can accept, which is just as 
    important. It states: &#133;committed to finding a fair and responsible 
    stadium financing solution that will not increase the tax burden of the 
    average Minnesotan.&quot; However, it too makes the critical mistake of 
    not talking about what it will put up or is willing to, leaving it look 
    as if they seek full stadium funding, which, of couse, will not fly with 
    the voters. Therefore, you might consider changing it as follows for use 
    as your mantra, as everyone clasps hands: </p>
  <p>The legislature is committed to finding a fair and responsible stadium 
    financing solution that will include over half of the costs being contributed 
    by the team, and the rest using mechanisms which will not only not increase 
    the tax burden of the average Minnesotan, but which will return revenue 
    to the state in excess of what it invests in the projects, thus being 
    a benefit for all.</p>
  <p>The general consensus I am receiving from all of these sources is that 
    people want the Vikings to stay but that political concerns have gotten 
    in the way, especially after the debacle of 1997 with the Twins. It is 
    my belief that the suggestions here will alleviate that and enable all 
    stakeholder parties to achieve their goals without undue negative political 
    fallout, especially if the steps of #7 below are followed: &quot;Team/Legislative 
    Breakthrough Process: 4 Tracks, 3 Sets of Models, 1 Red Carpet.&quot;</p>
  <p>The attachments to the August 10, 2001 letter to Speaker Sviggum and 
    Senator Moe are:</p>
  <p>1. &quot;Draft: Four track Process to Follow to Build Twin City Stadiums,&quot; 
    PJJ, 7-23-01</p>
  <p>2. My contributions to a St. Paul run Internet on-line list serve discussion 
    group, politalk-mn1@yahoogroups.com on &quot;Public Financing of Sports 
    Stadiums</p>
  <p>3. &quot;Beware of the Coming Corporate Backlash&quot;, Industry Week 
    [also available at www.industryweek.com/CurrentArticles/asp/articles.asp?ArticleId=1006 
    ]. It speaks to the need for the private sector to take the lead before 
    it gets bound by needless government regulations or negative and incorrect 
    public opinion</p>
  <p>4. &quot;A Multi-Use Sports-Entertainment MODEL For Profitably Building 
    and Operating a Professional Sports/Stadium/Arena/Team/Franchise, May 
    22, 2001, a generic re-write of a proposal submitted to the Vikings August 
    2000. </p>
  <p>5. &quot;<a href="confrescolum.html" target="_blank">10 Models of Conflict 
    Resolution</a>,&quot; Appendix A (one of three) of the August 2000 proposal 
    to the Vikings, and now summarized in Appendix H of Attachment #4, with 
    the longer version at attachment #5. These answer Dave Jennings&#146; 
    call, in the August 10, 2000 Star Tribune on-line, that: &quot;someone 
    other that the teams have to create a public discussion about the future 
    of the Twins and the Vikings in Minnesota. The teams are crying out for 
    somebody to call the family meeting.&quot; These 10 have since been expanded 
    to 14.</p>
  <p>6. &quot;<a href="communications.html">47 Models of Communications Strategy</a>,&quot; 
    Appendix C of the August 2000 proposal to the Vikings (34 models then), 
    and now summarized in Appendix K of Attachment #4 (as 40 models) and. 
    These 40 have since been expanded to 47. They can be used to quickly and 
    cheaply educate the public and the stakeholders of the need to go forward. </p>
  <p>A key concern is the report in three papers that the Vikings are moving 
    to L.A. This appeared in stories of (Charlie Walters, Pioneer Press, Patrick 
    Reusse, Minneapolis Star Tribune Larry Fitzgerald, Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder). 
    Whatever may have been discussed is not written in stone. If what has 
    been discussed says L.A. because a new stadium is not being built, the 
    people of Minnesota, together, can act to reverse that, to ensure for 
    the people of Minnesota that their Vikings won&#146;t follow their Lakers. 
    A way of facilitating keeping the Vikings is what I have outlined below 
    under &quot;Team/Legislative Breakthrough Process: 4 Tracks, 3 Sets of 
    Models, 1 Red Carpet.&quot;</p>
  <p>This issue has a long history, including the previous owners. Therefore, 
    this is not about Red McCombs. It is about the long term relationship 
    of a people and its team. The constant is the people. Owners and players 
    come and go. Fans go to see teams and, in many instances, specific players. 
    When three reporters from three different papers talk about the team moving 
    to L.A., the nature of the issue should be clear, a definite business 
    decision has been made in the sense that the team will play in a new stadium. 
    The only question is where: Minnesota, Los Angeles, Texas? The option 
    is still open to keep them in Minnesota. Question: why isn&#146;t anyone 
    openly trying to prevent a move? Are the &quot;powers&quot; not interested 
    in the people&#146;s interest in the people&#146;s team?</p>
  <p>These reporters have raised good questions. How can we provide them answers? 
    My suggestion is below under &quot;Team/Legislative Breakthrough Process: 
    4 Tracks, 3 Sets of Models, 1 Red Carpet.&quot;</p>
  <p>The Metrodome still has value, whether continued on its own or replaced 
    by something else. The suggestion of making the Metropolitan Sports Authority 
    a statewide sports/entertainment Indus-try agency, coordinating both amateur 
    and professional sports in Minnesota is an excellent idea (taking it beyond 
    being just a city-based facilities management agency to a state agency). 
    The Metro- dome itself can continue, even if the other teams obtained 
    new stadiums. The Metrodome also could mix and match from the 10 models 
    to finance a new mission and still be successful and profitable. </p>
  <p>Do the Cities really want to have to play the &quot;who lost the Vikings 
    or Twins game&quot;? And what politician wants to take that heat, especially 
    when there are 10 models that address these issues and enables them to 
    have their cake and eat it too, models which will only get better as both 
    the legislature and the teams adapt them to their collective and separate 
    needs? </p>
  <p>Minnesota is unique: and the empirical data is clear: (1) the fans already 
    come to all four (Vikings, Twins, Gophers, Wild), (2) the fans are already 
    spending money for tickets (the Vikings web site notes 60,000 season ticket 
    holders; I couldn&#146;t find a number on the Twins web page), and (3) 
    the Cities already enjoy a significant visitor base (the Mall of America 
    alone attracts over 40 million visitors a year, many from international 
    visits) to add to the regional traffic and the out of town day trippers. 
    It should also be noted that the &quot;private investment&quot; model 
    has been the traditional &quot;return on investment model.&quot; None 
    of the teams have tried the DreamWorks model that seeks dollars in exchange 
    first for non-material, psychic returns before eventually obtaining material 
    returns. L.A. will woo Red. Will Minnesota woo Red too?</p>
  <p>&quot;The Team/Legislative Breakthrough Process&quot; suggested to break 
    the legislative deadlock consists of: 4 Tracks, 3 Sets of Models, 1 Red 
    Carpet. The 4 tracks are</p>
  <p> (1) starting the conversation by all sides to discuss it (see Attachments 
    4 and 5); </p>
  <p>(2) legislative suggestions which includes working with all four entities 
    and &quot;safety nets&quot; for both the legislature/tax payers and the 
    teams/tax revenue generators; </p>
  <p>(3) private funding models to be discussed to use, especially the DreamWorks 
    model and the commercial mixed use model that are discussed, and which 
    are included in Models 2, 4, 7, and 8; and, finally,</p>
  <p> (4) change the team model: from the traditional model of management/labor 
    to a senior executive model, employing as a discussion starter, the 12 
    part compensation structure of Model 4. All four tracks are encouraged 
    to use the 47 communications models of Attachment #6.</p>
  <p>The 3 sets of models are:</p>
  <p> (1) The 10 stadium financing models (in the August 10 letter); </p>
  <p>(2) the 14 conflict resolution models (Attachment #5); and </p>
  <p>(3) the 47 communication models (Attachment #6).</p>
  <p>The 1 red carpet: the wooing of the owners and the taxpayers (part of 
    the Four Tracks 1st track). Red is the stand-in for the team. To woo and 
    win the Vikings: Red needs to be wooed and won. For those who say he should 
    be wooing Minnesota, please note: he has wooed Minnesota. But Minnesota 
    has not accepted his advances. Nonetheless, he has what Minnesota wants: 
    the Vikings. All he wants is a stadium. And he will get a stadium. That 
    was the same position of the former owners as well. The only question 
    is where: Minnesota, L.A., or Texas? In situations like this, certain 
    rituals are needed. The most important is the promising of a stadium now 
    and working out the details later. Use the Vikings own words as a base.</p>
  <p> Minnesota needs to say to Red: </p>
  <p>The legislature is committed to finding a fair and responsible stadium 
    financing solution that will include over half of the costs being contributed 
    by the team, and the rest using mechan-isms which will not only not increase 
    the tax burden of the average Minnesotan, but which will return revenue 
    to the state in excess of what it invests in the projects, thus being 
    a benefit for all.</p>
  <p>The model for running a red carpet was laid down by Harvey Mackay to 
    win the Superbowl for the Metrodome. This is #1. Doing so for Red would 
    convince him the state really wants to keep the Vikings.</p>
  <p> Other things that could be done include </p>
  <p>(2) find several convenient, yet well-appointed &quot;homes away from 
    home&quot; for them to consider purchasing/use while in Minnesota, offering 
    substitute sites in the meantime;</p>
  <p> (3) Invite the McCombs to stay over Sunday nights to meet Mondays with 
    various key leaders in business (CEOs), government (Governor), legislative 
    (Senators and Representatives), including key staffers, to discuss the 
    Stadium and the future; include his daughter or other key family members, 
    as they determine; </p>
  <p>(4) If, because the grandkids have to be back for school the next day, 
    arrange such intimate dinners on Saturday; </p>
  <p>(5) Arrange events for the grandkids while they are in town if they stay 
    over on non-school Sundays or stay over Saturday nights;</p>
  <p> (6) Discuss ways with Red to make the stadium work for the team but 
    also for special events, like the Olympics, and other major national and 
    world events; </p>
  <p>(7) Arrange for them to meet representatives of local churches in order 
    to have a local church to go to on Sunday mornings when they stay over 
    Saturday night; </p>
  <p>(8) Ask him what else would make it comfortable for him to be in Minnesota 
    during this period, and respond accordingly </p>
  <p>(9) Have an &quot;Honorary Minnesotan&quot; ceremony. The solutions presented 
    could be taken to anyone from the Governor&#146;s office to the Mayors&#146; 
    offices to the legislators, to help them lead the drive to get the stadiums. 
    They want a horse to pull the wagon. These models provide 10 horses. Minnesota 
    has THREE &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; historic opportunities to LEAD 
    THE NATION in sports management (which would help increase the team and 
    city brands and reach) by :</p>
  <p>(1) Showing how to deal with the stadium issue in general in this new 
    day of tax reductions taking over from tax maximizing (every owner/city/legislature/tax 
    payers will thank you).</p>
  <p>(2) Showing how to, in particular, use this model to solve multiple stadium 
    solutions as well (football, baseball, basketball, other sports (for college 
    stadiums, see letter&#146;s Appendix A). </p>
  <p>(3) Showing how to transform the economics of professional sports, especially 
    the NFL, before it is dragged down the MSB path of killing the goose that 
    lays the golden eggs. </p>
  <p>To repeat the basic idea: IF the various main stakeholder groups in Minnesota 
    (teams and their owners &euro; legislators and their jurisdictions &euro; 
    state and city officials and agencies &euro; Metrodome and its managers 
    &euro; corporations and the university &euro; urban/suburban/rural &euro; 
    white/black/brown/ yellow &euro; fans and non-fans &euro; and citizens 
    of all ages and persuations) can see that they are all partners in the 
    sports-entertainment industry, THEN no one will lose and all will be winners 
    (in economic, cultural, and quality-of-life terms). If each can help the 
    other get what they need and what they want, all will get what they need 
    and want. That is always at the heart of any great enterprise that involves 
    great institutions and individuals. </p>
  <p>Most sincerely, </p>
