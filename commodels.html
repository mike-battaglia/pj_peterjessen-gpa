  <p align="center"><b>An &quot;Ideal Type&quot; Model With 10 Components 
    For Use As A Standard For Comparison </b><b>Positioning for top and bottom 
      line success<br>
      (Marketing, Sales, Profits, Capital Valuation)</b></p>
  <p align="center">Peter J. Jessen, 11/19/00</p>
  <p>(Copy sent to MN legislature, 
    House Speaker, Steve Sviggum and Senate President Roger Moe and others: 
    Roy Terwilliger, Larry Fitzgerald, John Marty, David Jennings, Otis Courtney, 
    Sarah Psick, Victor Moore, Tom Hanson)</p>
  <p>The &quot;mantra&quot; remains and continues: Evaluate in light of the 
    10 competitive analysiscomponents to best position for marketing, sales, 
    and bottom line success. </p>
  <p>Regardless of industry, companies seek to create, develop, produce and 
    distribute goods and services in such a manner that market share will 
    be kept and increased, and profits and valuation will be added and increased. 
    In today's so-called new economy (in which the &quot;laws&quot; of the 
    &quot;old&quot; economy still hold), this must also include the utilization 
    of the Internet both in-house and with customers, clients, vendors, and 
    suppliers, using a combination of Internet, Intranet, and Extranet protocols 
    on the World Wide Web. </p>
  <p>Needed is both steak (service, product) and sizzle (differentiates the 
    steak favorably against the competion in the eyes of potential clients 
    and customers). </p>
  <p>Key for any company is to free its customers/clients from distractions 
    in order to enable them to achieve <b
>faster turnaround and killer content,</b> and thus creating a <b>value chain 
      across all media</b> of the client/customer, doing all of this at an affordable 
    price below that of the competition. </p>
  <p>Key is the &quot;definition of the situation.&quot;Who will be the WINNER?The 
    one which&quot;the definition of the situation&quot; with actual and potential 
    clients, customers and prospects through better positioning in the marketplace

style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Max Weber, considered to be the giant 
    among the non-Marxist founders of social science, coined the term <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>&quot;ideal type&quot;</b> in the first of 
    his classic two volume set, Economy and Society, by which he meant an 
    abstract or way of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>categorizing</b> the <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>essential characteristics</b> of any social 
    phenomenon, individual, or group in order to be able <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>to meaningfully compare</b> various patterns of human thought and behavior. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But ideal types do <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>not</b> refer to a stereotype, as it is a 
    factual statement rather than one that is unfairly positive or negative. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In other words, it doesn't refer to &quot;good&quot; 
    or best&quot; but to categories (e. g. , &quot;criminals&quot; and &quot;priests&quot; 
    can both be analyzed as ideal types:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>which is to say:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>what it is that each category represents). <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Thus an <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ideal 
      type</b> is a composite of real cases to reveal essential features. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Thus, his classic ideal type description of 
    bureaucracy is that it features a division of labor, a hierarchy, regulations, 
    impersonality, record keeping, administrative staff, and a career structure 
    (modern day social scientists add informal primary relationships that 
    exist in all bureaucracies). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Whether 
    this is good or bad, positive or negative, usually depends on how the 
    observer defines the situation in terms of their political or other beliefs. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Regardless, this description still accurately 
    describes what a bureaucracy is. </span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>All <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>modern organizations</b> are bureaucracies. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Capitalist/democratic societies and their institutions reflect an 
    ideal type called <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>legal-rational 
      authority,</b> meaning that laws/rules/regulations are key, not rulers, 
    such that officials of both the private and public sectors can exercise 
    power only within legally or procedurally defined limits (along with traditions 
    which develop over time and the charisma followers sometimes attribute 
    to their leaders). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Despite the trend to more <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>&quot;rational&quot;</b> (by which Max Weber 
    meant the deliberate, matter-of-fact calculation of the most efficient 
    means to accomplish any particular goal), many people actually continue 
    to think in pre-modern <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>traditional</b> terms (what Weber would call sentiments and beliefs about the world that 
    are passed from generation to generation), which strongly reflects on 
    the past (thinking) and reflects the past (looks like). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The key to Weber is that ideal types 
    were carefully constructed in order to serve <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>interpretation,</b> in order to better typify what is being studied. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In other words, ideal types have a specific <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>cognitive 
      purpose,</b> in our case to conduct a competitive analysis, which are 
    best conducted when the information/data provides empirical verification 
    of the use of the concepts involved. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>What this means is that we are <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>not</b> seeking some universal laws of competition nor a set of causal relationships 
    to credit or blame success or failure in marketing and sales (although 
    this process could be used for the purpose of evaluating sales techniques 
    and results), but rather statements of meaning to facilitate an accurate 
    interpretation so that the analysis of to compete, to partner, or acquire 
    can be made for accurately, as well as the strategies to use to follow 
    whichever of these three are determined as the best course of action:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>compete, partner, or acquire. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This is important for a simple reason (as seen 
    in the book length essay<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>of Peter 
    Berger and Hansfried Kellner, Sociology Reinterpreted), which is that 
    A &quot;human phenomena don't speak for themselves; they must be interpreted.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'></span></p>
  <p>Recommended is the use of Weber's &quot;ideal type&quot; as a kind of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>model-building device</b> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>to better 
    interpret </b>the data and information and complimentary action. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This covers both objective and subjective analysis 
    for, as Weber notes (p. 21) &quot;In the great majority of cases actual 
    action goes on in a state of inarticulate half-consciousness or actual 
    unconsciousness of its subjective meaning. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The actor is more likely to 'be aware' of it in a vague sense than 
    he is to 'know' what he is doing or be explicitly self-conscious about 
    it. In most cases his action is governed by impulse or habit.&quot;</p>
  <p>Thus, the competitive ideal type constructed and explained here should 
    hold true in any competitive analysis, including an internal analysis, 
    regardless of who the competitive analysis is made about vis a vis the 
    company, and regardless of whether all desired information is obtained 
    or not. </p>

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The world communications network--much 
    of it brand new and seemingly indestructible--is steaming straight toward 
    a price collapse of Titanic proportions. This collapse will drive a complete 
    reordering of the communications business. Investors need to place their 
    bets with care. </span><span
style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Today, communications demand is constrained 
    by high prices. In the United States, long distance prices have indeed 
    fallen--by half since AT&amp;T's divestiture of the local exchange companies 
    fifteen years ago--to an average of about 13¢ per minute for an interstate 
    call. But a phone call<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>is still just 64 kb/s, the same as it has been for 100 years. As 
    a result, over the past decade, total U. S. long distance company (IXC) 
    switched traffic (measured in minutes) grew by less than 10% per year. 
    Since the late 1980s, AT&amp;T's network volume has increased by less 
    than 7% per year. </span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>This is why AT&amp;T is having such 
    problems, and why their investments have drawn them closer to the Internet 
    black hole, because their debt strategy doesnt let them drop price, and 
    the newcomer competition, not saddled with debt, under cut them in price, 
    with their risking getting sucked in (it almost happened to IBM in the 
    1980s). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We wait with anticipation 
    to see how they handle it. </span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The American economy is being turned 
    upside down in one of the most tumultuous revolutions in world history. 
    The result: the United States is putting more distance between itself 
    and other economies than any one had imagined possible. Seventy percent 
    of the world's top 50 companies by market capitalization are American. 
    Annual growth in the U. S. GNP is the size of large countries; the Dow 
    has gone through the roof, reaching unthinkable heights; the nation has 
    seen a burst of exuberant growth that few would have expected during the 
    collapse of confidence following the war in Vietnam a generation ago. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>FutureWealth is about the sources of this extraordinary 
    prosperity and what it means for investors. </span><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The strategy in terms of being competitive 
    thus means staying ahead of the information cost curve in order to stay 
    profitable and build shareholder value. <span style="mso-spacerun:

    language of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>&quot;black hole&quot; </b>has been picked up, as seen in the WSJ article of 10/13/00, p. C1,

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The Internet is a tool which will enable

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>As Pomerleau and McGuire point out 
    in their white paper, &quot;Merging Physical Plants and Virtual Plants:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A Strategy for Business Success,&quot; the pre-Internet world of

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>As they then ask, &quot;How can we best use 
    the unique opportunities of this new environment?&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Part of the answer to this question is to persuade

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Pomerleau and McGuire state the dramatic 
    change this way:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>&quot;Leaders

  <p><span

  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;'>What is the Wireless Web?</span></b><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
color:black'></span></b></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>The wireless Web is the 
    Internet at your fingertips Ë literally. With the use of a wireless-enabled 
    phone or personal digital assistant (PDA), users can access much of the 
    same information that is available on the desktop version of the Internet. 
    The wireless Web provides the connectivity of your desktop when you are 
    on the go. News and other useful information can be immediately accessed 
    any time, anywhere. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>According to Jupiter Communications, 
    users of browser-enabled mobile phones will soar from 1. 1 million in 
    1999 to 79. 4 million in 2003, while Internet-capable PDA users are expected 
    to increase from 5. 2 million to 12 million in the same period. In fact, 
    many international users will likely own an Internet-ready PDA or mobile 
    phone before they own a PC. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;'>How does the Wireless Web work?</span></b><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
color:black'></span></b></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Part of what's making the 
    wireless Web revolution possible is the Wireless Application Protocol 
    (WAP), which is the standard created for enabling wireless devices to 
    access the Web. Established websites such as Amazon. com and Bloomberg. 
    com have used the WAP standard to enable their Web sites for wireless, 
    essentially creating a new website with pared-down content and graphics 
    suitable for viewing on a small screen. According to some analysts, 95 
    percent of today's wireless device producers are following the WAP standards. 
    Those that dont follow the WAP standards, such as the Palm computing company, 
    have created their own standards for translating HTML (the standard coding 
    language currently used on the Internet) for wireless access. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Today's wireless data transmission 
    rates range from 9. 6 to 14. 4Kbps, which is considered very slow by Internet 
    standards, particularly when trying to access lengthy e-mail messages 
    or attachments, or downloading graphics. In order to address this problem, 
    there is a huge international effort to improve bandwidth and speed from 
    a variety of vendors. These new technologies will increase data transmission 
    speeds in excess of 384 Kbps, making it a much more useful technology 
    for every day use. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;'>How can I use the wireless Web?</span></b><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
color:black'></span></b></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Wireless Web services include 
    games, mobile banking, airline ticket booking, e-mail, restaurant menus, 
    directions, and similar kinds of Internet information. In fact, the new 
    service is so popular that over the last year it has added 3 million subscribers, 
    all of whom have access to more than 4,000 wireless-enabled Web sites--and 
    both subscribers and wireless-enabled Web sites are growing. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Most people today use the 
    Wireless Web to retrieve real-time information such as news, sports scores, 
    stock quotes or email. A boon to wireless communication occurred in May 
    2000, when the U. S. military stopped scrambling the signal from its global 
    positioning system, allowing private citizens and companies to take advantage 
    of satellite technology that can pinpoint precisely where a person is 
    located. Most devices have yet to take advantage of this new capability, 
    but some can find where a user is located (if the user desires) and provide 
    location-specific content. For example, users with this capability can 
    request information on the latest movies and get back reviews of movies 
    playing at local theatres. It wont be long before all the wireless providers 
    will offer this technology. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>So, how can you use the 
    wireless Web? The answer is: Today you can use it for quick access to 
    a multitude of facts and to keep in touch with business associates, friends 
    and family via email. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Tomorrow 
      it may be your main form of communication and information access. </b>Don't

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Wireless links are different 
    from conventional sites in that they follow a different protocol, called 
    wireless application protocol, or WAP. These wireless URLs are cumbersome 
    to type into your phone. WiredCEO provides a way to view specially selected 
    links on your desktop computer, and choose those that you want to view 
    on your phone. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>WiredCEO works similarly 
    to CEOExpress in that it presents only the best of the best wireless links 
    in a highly organized format, and allows you to customize a personal page 
    with your favorite resources. WiredCEO enables you to do all the work 
    on your desktop computer that would be extremely difficult from your wireless 
    phone because of its small screen and keypad. Rather than trying to learn 
    and dial in complicated URLs, all you have to do is indicate on the WiredCEO 
    desktop site which links youd like to access on your wireless device just 
    by selecting them with a mouse. Select links that will provide you with 
    news, weather, sports scores, stock quotes, and more. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'> </span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Note: Unlike CEOExpress, the links on 
    your WiredCEO desktop site are not &quot;clickable&quot; from a desktop 
    computer because they are written in wireless protocol. You will not be 
    able to view the links from your desktop computer before sending them

    following about what to do in the new economy:</span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>1. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Reengineer Your Company</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Get ready for another round of reengineering. 
    Brace yourself--this one's on steroids. The Internet lets us communicate 
    instantly with every supplier, partner, and customer--and, in many cases, 
    lets them communicate with each other. </span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>2. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Throw Out The Old Business Model</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Ask yourself a very basic question: 
    Just who are we in the Internet Age? As we face more global competition 
    online and have to cut our prices, we need to reexamine our business model. 
    Maybe we should take a cue from MicroAge Inc. , the PC distributor. Realizing 
    the Net would make it easier for resellers to bypass distributors, it 
    started transforming itself in 1995 into a service company, helping corporations 
    with installation and training. Get this--now it even offers data on rival 
    distributors' inventory in case MicroAge's fulfillment arm is out of stock 
    on something--a way to earn customers' loyalty. Nothing's too strange 
    to consider. </span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>3. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Buyer Always Wins</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Understand that the buyer runs the 
    show on the Net. Up to now, buyers faced big obstacles to getting the 
    best prices and service--limited time and data to compare vendors' products 
    and the cost of dealing with far-flung suppliers. No more. The anytime-anywhere 
    Net knocks down those barriers. It's spawning middlemen galore to give 
    buyers more information. </span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>4. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Hold Your Customer's Hand</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Roll out the red carpet--or whatever 
    the cyber-quivalent is. Have you bought a book at Amazon. com?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Try it--they've reinvented customer service. Don't be surprised 
    if our rivals start copying Amazon's methods. </span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>5. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Go Ahead, Farm Out Those Jobs</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Cancel that vacation--we've got to 
    move fast! None of our usual round of studies and meetings. And we have 
    no time to do everything ourselves--nor any need to. The instant communications 
    power of the Net shatters the physical-world need to do product development, 
    manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and customer management all in-house. </span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>6. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>No Web Site Is An Island</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>We should not treat cyberspace as a 
    separate universe. Look at Charles Schwab. By leveraging its brand name 
    online and using its offices as a place to introduce clients to Web access, 
    it has managed to stay far ahead of upstarts like E*Trade Group. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Likewise, Day-Timers recently launched a free Web calendar to compete 
    with a raft of online upstarts while also promoting its traditional paper 
    and software schedulers. As we go online, our brand name and purchasing 
    power can work to our advantage. </span><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>7. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Create An Online Sense Of Community</span></b><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Think global. People all over the world 
    are congregating into virtual communities on the Web, and we want to be 
    part of that. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>as these communities 
    embrace E-biz, we need to</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>help our retailers <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>[</b>customers<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>]</b> plug into them--perhaps by offering 
    them bundles of services such as chat and free E-mail. </span><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

    capitalists are scouring the country for new industries to wire up. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span

text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>9. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A Web Of Nerds? Don't Believe It</span></b><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>We need to persuade everyone at Mid-America 
    Paper that the Web is not Nerdville anymore. It's becoming part of everyday 
    life. By 2003, International Data estimates 510 million people will be 
    online worldwide. (By the way, why on earth do only half our employees 
    have browser access? No wonder we're behind. Some 159 million people worldwide 
    are now online!)</span><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Get wired--or we'll get whacked. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> you've got to get closer to the Net than reading the E-mail your 
    secretary prints out. You're not aloneƒonly 25% of CEOs in a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers 
    survey regularly log on to the Net. But you've got</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>to get your fingers on that keyboard 
    every day. Surf the Web. Talk to the nerds in the systems department. 
    You'll see what I mean. This is something you can't delegate. </span><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Jack, I know this must feel like a 
    slap in the face. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But if we don't get E-bized, we'll soon be pulp--and I'll be out 
    of a job anyway. </span><span style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>And so, what about Europe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>FutureWealth points out that &quot;the United Kingdom is becoming 
    the information entrepot of Europe&quot; (p. 309). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>And here is a key point:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The consequences of the United Kingdoms policy 
    for the continentals is incalculable. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Riding its low-cost information strategy, Britain is emerging as 
    the dominant force in services in the union. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It could easily wind up controlling EU banking, advertising, accounting, 
    and insurance markets by early in the next century. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Britain keeps itself less 
    regulated than its neighbors and is thus better adapted to exploiting 
    the markets of the next century&quot; (p. 309). </span><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>And Asia?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Again, FutureWealth (pp. 13-14):<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>&quot;Asian countries are staggering under the 
    twin burdens of political and corporate ineptitude, and they desperately 
    need to reform both.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>And 
    how do they rank?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Singapore, South 
    Korea and Taiwan are and will fare better than China or Japan, as the 
    latter continues its &quot;long recession&quot; (p. 314). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In BW, 9-25-00, p. 184, the article &quot;Mitsubishi:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Failed Vision,&quot; notes the country &quot;just can't seem to 
    tolerate radical change&quot; as &quot;the emphasis is on consensus and 
    saving face.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>These have not 
    worked well in either old or new economy. The biggest question mark and 
    greatest challenge is China:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>&quot;the 
    falling cost of information shifts power inexorably to individuals and 
    away from the state.&quot;</span><span style='font-family:Verdana'> </span></p>
